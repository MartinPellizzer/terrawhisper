<h2 id="3">Side Effects of phaseolus vulgaris</h2>
<p>Phaseolus vulgaris leads gas because it contains oligosaccharides, which are complex carbohydrates that are not fully digested in the small intestine and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Phaseolus vulgaris causes bloating due to the accumulation of gas in the digestive tract, which can stretch the stomach and intestines, leading to a feeling of fullness and discomfort. Phaseolus vulgaris causes nausea because the oligosaccharides can also irritate the gastrointestinal lining, triggering an inflammatory response and digestive upset.</p>
<p>Phaseolus vulgaris causes swelling because the body may react to the presence of undigested compounds by increasing mucus production and inflammatory responses in the digestive system.</p>

<p>The 13 most common side effects of Phaseolus vulgaris are shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="/images/herbs/phaseolus-vulgaris-side-effects.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
