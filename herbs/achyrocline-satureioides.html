<p> The plant has a long history in traditional medicine, where it was employed to treat respiratory conditions, skin irritations, and as a calming agent for anxiety and insomnia.  In some tribes, Blue Mistflower was also incorporated into ceremonial practices, believed to bring clarity and protection during rituals or healing ceremonies.  Today, its use persists in herbal medicine, with its flowers still used to make teas that help alleviate coughs and promote relaxation.</p>

<p> It is also rich in antioxidants, such as quercetin and rutin, as well as vitamins like vitamin C and various B-complex vitamins, and minerals including calcium, magnesium, and iron.  These compounds work synergistically to support immune function, reduce inflammation, and promote cellular health by neutralizing free radicals and enhancing antioxidant defenses.  The essential oils and terpenes in Blue Mistflower may also have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, making it beneficial for respiratory and skin conditions.</p>
