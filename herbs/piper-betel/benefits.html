<h2 id="3">4. Relieve fever</h2>
<p>Fever is a common health condition characterized by an elevated body temperature, often indicating an underlying infection or illness.</p>
<p>A high body temperature, also known as hyperthermia or a thermal imbalance, can result from viral or bacterial infections, inflammation, or immune responses.</p>
<p>It is frequently experienced by individuals suffering from colds, flu, or other contagious diseases.</p>
<p>The piper betel plant, also known as betel leaf, is traditionally used to alleviate fever symptoms due to its cooling and antipyretic properties.</p>
<p>Its active compounds help reduce body heat and support the body's natural cooling mechanisms.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/piper-betel-benefits-relieve-fever.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with relieve fever?</h2>
<p>Piper betel relieve fever because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds possess anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties that help reduce body temperature. Alkaloids like piperylene and piperic acid contribute to its fever-reducing effects. Flavonoids in the plant also support immune function and reduce fever symptoms.</p>
<p>Overall, the combination of these natural compounds makes Piper betel an effective remedy for relieving fever.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Soothe gums</h2>
<p>Gingivitis is a common oral health issue characterized by inflammation of the gums.</p>
<p>Often referred to as gum irritation or gum redness, it typically results from the accumulation of plaque along the gum line.</p>
<p>This condition is frequently caused by poor dental hygiene, leading to bacterial buildup that irritates the gum tissue.</p>
<p>It is commonly experienced by individuals who do not floss regularly or neglect routine dental check-ups.</p>
<p>The piper betel plant, known for its soothing properties, can help alleviate gum inflammation and promote healing.</p>
