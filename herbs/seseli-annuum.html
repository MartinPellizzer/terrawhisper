                <h1>Seseli Annuum</h1><p>Seseli annuum, commonly known as hemlock, is a flowering plant that has been historically used for its medicinal properties, though it is now primarily recognized for its toxic effects.</p><p>In traditional medicine, it was occasionally employed for its sedative and antispasmodic qualities, often in the treatment of ailments such as headaches, coughs, and nervous disorders. However, due to its highly poisonous nature, containing compounds like cicutoxin, its use in modern medicine has been largely abandoned. The plant's toxic properties have also made it a subject of caution and regulation, highlighting the fine line between therapeutic use and lethal toxicity.</p><p>Despite its dangerous profile, Seseli annuum remains an important study in the history of botanical medicine and toxicology.</p>
