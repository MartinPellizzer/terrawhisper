To ensure healthy growth, regular pruning of dead or diseased branches and periodic fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer are recommended. Harvesting should occur when the fruit turns a deep red or purple, typically in late summer to early autumn, using clean pruning shears to cut the fruit from the plant to avoid damaging the stem.</p><p>After harvesting, the fruits should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation to preserve their potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Pimenta officinalis, also known as the West Indian bay leaf, is a medicinal plant widely used for its aromatic and therapeutic properties.</p><p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.
