<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Hedeoma pulegioides reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and terpenoids, which inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes like COX-1 and COX-2, thereby decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and cytokines.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages, and by enhancing the activity of natural killer cells, which are crucial for fighting off infections and abnormal cells. It cures respiratory issues due to its expectorant and antispasmodic properties, which help loosen mucus, reduce bronchial spasms, and improve airflow in the lungs. It reduces cholesterol levels by increasing the excretion of bile acids and promoting the synthesis of HDL (good cholesterol), while simultaneously inhibiting the absorption of LDL (bad cholesterol) in the intestines.</p>
<p>It treats anxiety by modulating the central nervous system through its sedative and anxiolytic effects, which may involve interactions with GABA receptors and the reduction of stress hormone levels like cortisol.</p>
