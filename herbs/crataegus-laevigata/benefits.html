<p>Crataegus laevigata lowers cholesterol levels because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, by inhibiting its synthesis in the liver. Additionally, flavonoids in the plant may enhance the function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, promoting healthier lipid metabolism. The presence of these natural compounds also supports the overall cardiovascular health by preventing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Research suggests that regular consumption of Crataegus laevigata may contribute to maintaining optimal cholesterol levels.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics", Crataegus laevigata (also known as Crataegus oxyacantha) lowers cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic rats by causing a significant decrease in lipid deposits in the liver and aorta, as well as a remarkable reduction in cholesterol levels in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fractions.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Improves heart health</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, often leading to reduced blood flow and increased risk of heart attacks or strokes.</p>
<p>This condition is typically caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, a process known as atherosclerosis, which can be exacerbated by factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poor dietary habits.</p>
<p>It commonly affects older adults, individuals with a family history of heart problems, and those who lead sedentary lifestyles.</p>
