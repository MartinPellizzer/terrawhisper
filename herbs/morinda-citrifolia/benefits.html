<h2 id="0">1. Fights inflammation</h2>
<p>Inflammation is a chronic immune response that can lead to tissue damage and various diseases.</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation refers to a prolonged and persistent inflammatory process that may result from ongoing exposure to irritants or unresolved acute inflammation.</p>
<p>It is often caused by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and chronic stress, or by underlying conditions like autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>This condition commonly affects older adults, individuals with obesity, and those suffering from metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>The morinda citrifolia plant has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce the body's inflammatory response and support overall health.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/morinda-citrifolia-benefits-fights-inflammation.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with fights inflammation?</h2>
<p>Morinda citrifolia fights inflammation because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds work by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reducing oxidative stress in the body. Alkaloids like morindin and morin have been shown to modulate immune responses and decrease inflammatory markers. Flavonoids in the plant also contribute by scavenging free radicals and suppressing inflammatory pathways.</p>
<p>Together, these compounds make Morinda citrifolia a valuable natural remedy for managing inflammatory conditions.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", Morinda citrifolia has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Boosts immune system</h2>
