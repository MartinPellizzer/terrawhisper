After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area to preserve its potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain its medicinal properties for extended periods.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Aspidosperma quebracho blanco is a medicinal plant native to South America, known for its traditional use in treating various ailments, including inflammation and pain.
