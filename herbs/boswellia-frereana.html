Modern research has supported its potential in reducing inflammation by inhibiting the production of certain enzymes involved in the inflammatory response. The active compounds in Olibanum, such as boswellic acids, are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p><p>Due to its natural origin and growing scientific validation, Olibanum is increasingly being incorporated into contemporary herbal and pharmaceutical formulations for its health benefits.</p>
