The alkaloids, particularly rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, contribute to vasodilation and improved blood flow.</p>
<p>Flavonoids further support heart health by strengthening blood vessel walls and regulating blood pressure.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Reduces blood pressure</h2>
<p>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated pressure within the arteries.</p>
<p>This condition occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high, potentially leading to serious health complications.</p>
<p>It is commonly experienced by adults, particularly those with a family history of cardiovascular issues, poor diet, or sedentary lifestyles.</p>
