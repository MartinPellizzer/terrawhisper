<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Prunella vulgaris reduces inflammation pain by containing compounds like rosmarinic acid and flavonoids that inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and LOX, thereby decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</p>
<p>It prevents infection and promotes wound healing due to its antimicrobial properties, which inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, while also stimulating the production of collagen and enhancing cellular regeneration during the healing process. It improves immune system function by modulating the activity of immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells, and by increasing the production of cytokines that help fight off pathogens and regulate immune responses. It reduces infection-related fever and body temperature by acting as a natural antipyretic, helping to lower the body's core temperature through its influence on the hypothalamus and its anti-inflammatory effects that reduce fever-causing cytokines.</p>
<p>It improves skin health and regeneration by promoting collagen synthesis, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing the skin's barrier function, which helps in treating conditions like acne, eczema, and promoting faster recovery from skin injuries.</p>
