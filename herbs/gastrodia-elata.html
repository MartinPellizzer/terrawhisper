Polysaccharides from Gastrodia elata possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, making them valuable in treating autoimmune disorders and enhancing immune response. Flavonoids present in the plant contribute to its antioxidant and antiviral activities, supporting its role in preventing oxidative stress-related diseases.</p><p>These bioactive constituents collectively underpin the therapeutic potential of Gastrodia elata in various health conditions.</p><h2>Medicinal Preparations</h2><p>Gastrodia elata has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and powders, which are traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat conditions like headaches, dizziness, and vertigo.</p><p>These preparations are often made by decocting the dried rhizomes in water to extract their active compounds, including gastrodin and certain alkaloids. The resulting teas are consumed daily to support neurological health and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and insomnia. Tinctures, prepared by soaking the rhizomes in alcohol, offer a more concentrated form of the herb for faster absorption.</p><p>Additionally, powdered forms of Gastrodia elata can be mixed with other herbs to enhance their therapeutic effects in various formulations.</p><h2>Side Effects</h2><p>Gastrodia elata can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in high doses or by individuals with sensitive digestive systems.</p><p>It may also cause drowsiness or sedation due to its sedative properties, which can impair driving or operating heavy machinery.
