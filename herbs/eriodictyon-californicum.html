<p> It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9, where it can reach heights of up to six feet, producing striking blue or purple flowers.  For optimal growth, it requires minimal water once established, with regular watering during the first growing season to encourage deep root development.  To maintain healthy plants, prune dead or damaged branches in early spring and avoid over-fertilizing, as it is sensitive to excess nutrients.  Harvesting should occur in late summer to early fall when the leaves and flowers are most potent, using clean scissors to cut the top portion of the plant, ensuring the root system remains intact for future growth.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its medicinal potency.</p>
