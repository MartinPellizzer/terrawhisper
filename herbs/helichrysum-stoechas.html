Native to Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Western Asia, this plant thrives in regions including Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, and Libya. Morphologically, H. stoechas is a herbaceous perennial with erect, branched stems, and it produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny chrysanthemums, giving it the common name Yellow Chrysanthemum. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and aromatic, while the flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature, hence the name Everlasting Flower. It is also referred to as False Geranium, Scabious, Yellow Buttonweed, Common Helichrysum, Stoechas Immortelle, and Common Immortelle, reflecting its widespread use in traditional medicine and horticulture.<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2>Everlasting was used by ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans for its aromatic and medicinal properties, often incorporated into perfumes, incense, and salves. In traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, it has been valued for its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and calming effects, with formulations used to treat wounds, respiratory ailments, and stress. The plant holds cultural significance in various rituals, including being used in religious ceremonies and as a symbol of immortality and protection in some African and Mediterranean traditions. It is also featured in folk remedies such as teas to alleviate anxiety and topical applications for skin conditions, which continue to be practiced today. Its enduring presence in both historical and contemporary contexts highlights its deep-rooted cultural relevance and therapeutic value.<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2>Everlasting contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and terpenes, which contribute to its therapeutic properties. The plant is rich in antioxidants such as quercetin and kaempferol, which help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. It also provides essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals such as calcium and magnesium, supporting overall health and immune function. The essential oils in Everlasting, particularly those containing cineole and limonene, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. These compounds work synergistically to modulate cellular responses, enhance immune defense, and promote healing in various physiological systems.<h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2>Helichrysum stoechas has been widely recognized for its potent medicinal properties, particularly its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects, which support multiple body systems including the respiratory, digestive, and immune systems.

For internal use, adults are generally recommended to take 1 to 2 capsules daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision. The duration of use should be conservative, typically limited to 2 to 4 weeks, to avoid potential adverse effects.<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2>Helichrysum stoechas can be used with caution due to its potential medicinal properties, but it is important to be aware of its safety profile. While generally considered safe when used in appropriate doses, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, or skin irritation in some individuals. There is limited research on drug or herb interactions, but it is advisable to avoid combining it with anticoagulants or sedatives due to potential additive effects. Special populations, including pregnant or breastfeeding women and individuals with chronic illnesses, should avoid its use without medical supervision, as its safety in these groups has not been sufficiently established. To ensure safe use, consult a healthcare provider before taking helichrysum stoechas, follow recommended dosages, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2>Helichrysum stoechas grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Regular pruning and deadheading encourage continuous blooming and maintain plant health, while mulching helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. The best time to harvest is during the early morning or late afternoon, when the plant's essential oils are most concentrated, using sharp scissors to cut the flower heads just above the leaves. After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its potency and extend its shelf life.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Helichrysum stoechas, also known as the golden everlasting, is a medicinal plant valued for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
