<p>Hoodia gordonii triterpenoids, including compounds like hordenine and garcinol, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities, supporting immune function and tissue health.</p>
<p>Hoodia gordonii triterpenoid saponins, which are glycosides of triterpenoids, have been shown to possess hypoglycemic and cholesterol-lowering properties, making them of interest in the management of metabolic disorders.</p>
