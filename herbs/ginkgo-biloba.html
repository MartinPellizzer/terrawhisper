<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of ginkgo biloba</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba phytosterols, such as stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol, are plant sterols that contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties by modulating lipid metabolism and reducing arterial plaque formation.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba ginkgolides are a group of unique terpene lactones that exhibit potent antiplatelet and neuroprotective effects by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes and improving blood flow to the brain and extremities.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba flavonoids, including quercetin and kaempferol, act as powerful antioxidants that neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress, and support vascular health by strengthening blood vessel walls.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba bilobalide, another terpene lactone, enhances cognitive function by protecting neurons from damage and promoting neurotransmitter activity in the central nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of ginkgo biloba</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba leaf is commonly used in herbal medicine for its potential cognitive and circulatory benefits.</p>
<p>The leaf contains flavonoids and terpenoids, which are believed to improve blood flow and protect against oxidative stress.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations from the leaf include teas, tinctures, and capsules, often used to support memory and mental clarity.</p>
<p>The seed, on the other hand, contains ginkgolic acids and is less commonly used due to its potential toxicity, but it can be processed into oils or extracts for specific medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of ginkgo biloba</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol or another solvent, which allows for the extraction of active compounds like flavonoids and terpene lactones, making them a popular choice for enhancing cognitive function and circulation.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba capsules contain standardized extracts of the leaves, often with a specific concentration of active compounds, and are convenient for daily use, providing a consistent dose without the need for measuring or preparation.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba teas are made by steeping the dried leaves in hot water, offering a mild, slightly bitter flavor and a gentle way to consume the herb, though they may contain lower concentrations of active ingredients compared to other forms.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba decoctions involve boiling the leaves for an extended period to extract more potent compounds, resulting in a stronger preparation that is often used for its purported therapeutic effects on memory and blood flow.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of ginkgo biloba</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba headaches occur often because the herb can cause vasodilation, leading to increased blood flow and pressure in the brain.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba stomach upset occurs due to its potential to irritate the gastrointestinal tract, especially when taken in high doses or on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba sleep disturbances arise because it may act as a stimulant, affecting neurotransmitters involved in sleep regulation.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba allergic reactions happen in individuals sensitive to its compounds, such as ginkgolic acids, which can trigger symptoms like rash, itching, or swelling.</p>
