<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba leaf has been widely used in traditional medicine for its potential cognitive and circulatory benefits.</p>
<p>The leaves contain bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and terpene lactones, which are believed to improve blood flow and protect against oxidative stress. These properties make ginkgo leaf a popular ingredient in supplements aimed at enhancing memory, concentration, and overall brain function. In traditional Chinese medicine, the leaves have been used to treat conditions such as dementia, depression, and circulatory disorders.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that while some studies suggest possible benefits, scientific evidence remains inconclusive, and the use of ginkgo leaf should be approached with caution and under professional guidance.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol or another solvent, allowing the active compounds like flavonoids and terpene lactones to dissolve.</p>
<p>These tinctures are commonly used for cognitive enhancement, improved circulation, and memory support due to their ability to increase blood flow to the brain. They are typically taken in small doses, often diluted in water or another liquid, to avoid the strong taste of alcohol. Tinctures offer a fast-acting and potent method of consuming ginkgo biloba, making them popular among those seeking natural remedies for mental clarity and focus.</p>
<p>While they are effective, they should be used with caution, especially for individuals with alcohol sensitivities or those taking other medications.</p>
