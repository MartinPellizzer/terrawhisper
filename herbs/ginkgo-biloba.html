These preparations are typically made by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol or water to create tinctures or infusions, which are then used in various forms of traditional and modern medicine. In addition to oral consumption, ginkgo biloba is sometimes applied topically in the form of salves or oils for skin conditions.</p><p>Due to its long history of use in both Eastern and Western medicine, it remains a popular herb for promoting mental clarity and enhancing blood flow.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Ginkgo biloba can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are commonly reported in some users.</p><p>Headaches and dizziness may also occur, especially when taking higher doses or in individuals sensitive to the herb. Allergic reactions, including skin rashes and respiratory symptoms, can develop in people with a history of allergies or asthma. In rare cases, ginkgo biloba may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting ginkgo biloba, particularly for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
