<p> In ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic practices, it was employed to treat skin conditions, digestive issues, and respiratory ailments, with its berries and oils being highly prized.

<p> It can be prepared as a tea by steeping dried berries in hot water, or as a decoction by boiling them for a longer period, while an infusion involves soaking the plant material in water for a shorter time.  Topical applications include using the oil or powder directly on the skin for conditions like eczema or muscle pain.  For adults, the recommended dosage is typically 1-2 grams of dried berries per cup of tea, taken up to three times daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision, with a lower dose.</p>
<p> Due to its potent effects, it is advised to use hippophae rhamnoides sparingly and for short durations, unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Hippophae rhamnoides can be used as a medicinal plant with potential health benefits, but it is important to be aware of its safety profile.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when consumed in moderate amounts, it may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, or stomach cramps in some individuals.  It is also important to note that hippophae rhamnoides may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants and diabetes treatments, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Special populations such as pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid its use due to insufficient evidence on safety, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, it is recommended to follow recommended dosages, consult with a healthcare professional, and discontinue use if adverse reactions occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Hippophae rhamnoides grows best in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, in full sun to partial shade, and requires moderate water during establishment.</p>
<p> It thrives in temperate climates and is hardy in USDA zones 3 to 8, making it suitable for regions with cold winters and warm summers.  Regular pruning is essential to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth, while mulching around the base helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.  Harvesting should occur in late summer to early autumn when the berries are fully ripe and plump, using gentle hand-picking or small mesh bags to avoid damaging the plant.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the berries should be dried in a cool, shaded area or using low-heat drying methods, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to preserve their medicinal properties.</p>
