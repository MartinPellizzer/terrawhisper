<h2 id="4">Side Effects of phaseolus lunatus</h2>
<p>Phaseolus lunatus leads gas because it contains oligosaccharides, complex carbohydrates that are difficult for the human digestive system to break down, leading to fermentation in the gut and the production of gas.</p>
<p>Phaseolus lunatus causes bloating as the fermentation process increases intestinal pressure and produces excess air in the digestive tract. Phaseolus lunatus triggers cramps due to the distension of the intestines from gas buildup and the irritation caused by undigested sugars.</p>
<p>Phaseolus lunatus causes nausea because the body may react to the presence of difficult-to-digest compounds, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort and a feeling of sickness.</p>
