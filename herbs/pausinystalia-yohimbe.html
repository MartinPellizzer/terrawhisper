Some studies suggest it may aid in weight loss by increasing metabolic rate and suppressing appetite, though more research is needed to confirm these effects. However, it is important to note that yohimbe can cause side effects like increased heart rate, anxiety, and gastrointestinal discomfort.</p><p>Due to its potency, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p><a href="/herbs/pausinystalia-yohimbe/benefits.html">10 Best Health Beneift of pausinystalia yohimbe</a></p><h2>Bioactive Constituents</h2><p>Pausinystalia yohimbe has several bioactive constituents, such as alkaloids, which are responsible for its medicinal properties.</p><p>The most notable alkaloid is yohimbine, known for its ability to act as an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist.
