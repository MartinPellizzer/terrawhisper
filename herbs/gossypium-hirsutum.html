<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of gossypium hirsutum</h2>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum seed, commonly known as cottonseed, is the primary medicinal part of the plant, valued for its nutritional content and potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The fruit, which encases the seed, contains the oil-rich cotyledons and is also used in herbal preparations.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations from the seed include oil extracts, which are used for their emollient and anti-inflammatory properties, and seed powders that may support digestive health.</p>
<p>The fruit is often processed into oil as well, which can be applied topically for skin conditions or consumed in small amounts for its fatty acid benefits.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of gossypium hirsutum</h2>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried leaves and flowers of the cotton plant in hot water, often used for their purported calming and digestive benefits, though scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum decoctions involve simmering the plant material for a longer duration, which extracts more potent compounds and is traditionally used for its purported anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum tinctures are made by soaking the plant in alcohol or glycerin, allowing for concentrated extraction of active compounds, and are often used topically or internally for their potential antimicrobial and analgesic effects.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum creams are formulated with the plant’s extracts and are applied externally to address skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, though their efficacy remains largely anecdotal and requires further scientific validation.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of gossypium hirsutum</h2>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum results in allergic reactions because it contains proteins and other allergens that can trigger immune responses in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum causes skin irritation due to the presence of irritants such as urushiol-like compounds and fibers that can penetrate the skin and provoke inflammation.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum results in itching as the immune system releases histamines in response to the allergens and irritants it contains.</p>
<p>Gossypium hirsutum causes swelling because the inflammatory response leads to increased blood flow and fluid accumulation in affected tissues.</p>
