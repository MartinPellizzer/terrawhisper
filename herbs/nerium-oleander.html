                <h1>Nerium Oleander</h1><p>Nerium oleander, commonly known as the oleander, has been traditionally used for its potential medicinal properties, although it is important to note that all parts of the plant are highly toxic and should not be used without professional guidance.</p><p>Historically, it has been employed in herbal medicine to treat ailments such as skin conditions, digestive issues, and respiratory infections due to its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Some studies suggest that compounds found in oleander may have cardiovascular benefits, including the ability to lower blood pressure, though these findings are still under investigation. Despite its historical use, the plant's toxicity, particularly from the cardiac glycosides present in its leaves and flowers, makes it dangerous for human consumption.</p><p>Therefore, while oleander has shown some promising medicinal potential, its use is not recommended for therapeutic purposes without expert supervision.</p>
