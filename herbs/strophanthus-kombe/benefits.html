<p>It is often used traditionally to enhance blood flow and reduce symptoms associated with circulatory disorders.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Treat hypertension</h2>
<p>Strophanthus kombe treat hypertension because it contains bioactive constituents such as strophanthin and gitoxin, which have cardioactive properties that help regulate blood pressure.</p>
<p>These compounds act on the heart and blood vessels to improve cardiac function and reduce vascular resistance.</p>
<p>Hypertension-related ailments such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease can be alleviated through the use of this plant.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Strophanthus kombe should be used under professional guidance due to its potent effects.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Lower blood pressure</h2>
<p>Strophanthus kombe lower blood pressure because it contains bioactive constituents such as strophanthin and ouabain, which act as cardiac glycosides to strengthen heart contractions and improve circulation.</p>
<p>These compounds help regulate blood pressure by influencing the cardiovascular system's function.</p>
<p>This plant is beneficial for ailments such as hypertension and heart failure, where maintaining stable blood pressure is crucial.</p>
<p>It also supports overall cardiovascular health by reducing strain on the heart and blood vessels.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Relax blood vessels</h2>
<p>Strophanthus kombe relax blood vessels because it contains bioactive constituents such as cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, and flavonoids, which have vasodilatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce vascular resistance and improve blood flow.</p>
<p>This benefit can alleviate conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disorders.</p>
<p>It is also used to support heart health and manage symptoms related to circulatory insufficiency.</p>

<h2 id="5">6. Reduce cholesterol</h2>
<p>Strophanthus kombe reduce cholesterol because it contains bioactive constituents such as cardenolides and alkaloids, which help lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.</p>
<p>These compounds work by inhibiting enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis and increasing the excretion of cholesterol from the body.</p>
<p>Conditions such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension are related to high cholesterol levels and can be alleviated through the cholesterol-lowering effects of this plant.</p>
<p>Its traditional use in African medicine supports its role in managing cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2 id="6">7. Improve kidney function</h2>
