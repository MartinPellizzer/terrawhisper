<h2 id="0">1. Treat heart failure</h2>
<p>Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs.</p>
<p>It occurs when the heart muscle becomes weakened or stiffened, leading to reduced cardiac output.</p>
<p>This condition can result from various factors such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or prolonged stress on the heart.</p>
<p>It commonly affects older adults, individuals with chronic illnesses, and those with a history of heart attacks.</p>
<p>The strophanthus kombe plant has been studied for its potential to support heart function and alleviate symptoms associated with this condition.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica", Strophanthus kombe, the document mainly talks about the positive effects of TFH (presumably derived from Strophanthus kombe) on heart failure in dogs, suggesting it can strengthen cardiac pump function and improve heart health.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Improve circulation</h2>
<p>Poor circulation, also known as circulatory insufficiency or inadequate blood flow, occurs when blood struggles to move efficiently through the blood vessels, often leading to reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues.</p>
<p>This condition can result from factors such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, or prolonged inactivity, and is commonly experienced by older adults, individuals with sedentary lifestyles, and those with cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>The strophanthus kombe plant is believed to enhance circulation by promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow.</p>
<p>Its traditional use in herbal medicine suggests potential benefits for individuals suffering from peripheral artery disease or chronic venous insufficiency.</p>
