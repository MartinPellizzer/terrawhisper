<p>Brassica juncea isothiocyanates are bioactive compounds derived from the hydrolysis of glucosinolates, known for their potent antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, which contribute to the herb's therapeutic value.</p>
<p>Brassica juncea glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds that serve as natural defense mechanisms in the plant, and when broken down, they produce isothiocyanates, which have been studied for their role in detoxification and disease prevention.</p>
<p>Brassica juncea sinigrin is a specific type of glucosinolate that, upon enzymatic hydrolysis, releases allyl isothiocyanate, a compound with strong antibacterial and antifungal effects, commonly found in mustard seeds.</p>
<p>Brassica juncea vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function, skin health, and the absorption of iron, further enhancing the herb's nutritional and medicinal profile.</p>
