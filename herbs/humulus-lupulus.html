<h2 id="1">Herbal Preparations of humulus lupulus</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried lupulus cones in hot water, often used for their bitter and aromatic qualities, and are popular in traditional herbal medicine for their potential digestive and calming effects.</p>
<p>Humulus lupulus decoctions involve boiling the herb for a longer period, which extracts more of its active compounds, making it effective for more potent therapeutic applications such as treating digestive issues or respiratory conditions.</p>

<p>It leads to drowsiness because it contains compounds that act as mild sedatives, slowing down brain activity and promoting relaxation.</p>
<p>Humulus lupulus triggers headaches, possibly due to its impact on blood vessels and the release of certain neurotransmitters that can cause vasodilation.</p>
