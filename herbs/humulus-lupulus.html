Additionally, hop extracts are sometimes incorporated into topical applications for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These preparations are valued for their potential to promote relaxation, improve sleep quality, and support overall wellness.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Humulus lupulus can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, especially when consumed in large quantities or in concentrated forms.</p><p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to hops, leading to symptoms like skin rashes, itching, or respiratory issues. Prolonged or excessive use of hops has been associated with liver toxicity in some studies, though more research is needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, hops contain compounds that can interact with certain medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.</p><p>Due to these potential risks, it is advisable to use humulus lupulus in moderation and consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into one's health regimen.</p>
