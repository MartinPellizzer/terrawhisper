<p>Eucommia ulmoides reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and alkaloids that inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby mitigating oxidative stress and tissue damage.</p>
<p>It reduces anxiety by modulating the central nervous system through the regulation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which help calm neuronal activity and reduce stress responses. It decreases depression by enhancing the availability of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are crucial for mood regulation and emotional well-being. It improves immunity by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing the activity of natural killer cells, which are essential for defending the body against pathogens.</p>
<p>It supports muscle function by promoting the synthesis of proteins and providing essential nutrients that aid in muscle repair and growth, thereby improving overall physical performance.</p>
