Additionally, Stellaria media may have anti-inflammatory properties that can aid in reducing inflammation associated with various health conditions. The plant is rich in vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C and potassium, which contribute to immune support and overall cellular function.</p><p>Furthermore, some traditional uses suggest it may have diuretic effects, which can help in maintaining fluid balance and supporting kidney health.</p>
