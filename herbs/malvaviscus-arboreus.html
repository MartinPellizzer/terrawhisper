<p> To ensure safe use, always follow recommended dosages, consult a qualified healthcare professional, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Malvaviscus arboreus grows as a perennial shrub in warm climates, thriving in well-drained soil with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, and requiring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.  It prefers regular watering during the growing season but should be allowed to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.  Regular pruning is recommended to encourage bushier growth and remove dead or diseased branches, while mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  The best time to harvest the leaves and flowers is during the spring and summer months when their medicinal compounds are most concentrated, using clean, sharp scissors to cut the stems just above a leaf node.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant parts should be dried in a cool, dark, well-ventilated area to preserve potency, then stored in airtight containers away from light and moisture to maintain their therapeutic properties.</p>
