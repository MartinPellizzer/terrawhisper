<p> Native to the arid and semi-arid regions of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming, this plant is also referred to by numerous common names such as Grindelweed, Desert Gumweed, California Gumweed, Desert Gumplant, Grindelgrass, California Poppy, Desert Gourd, California Grindelia, Grindel Bush, California Grindelweed, Meadow Poppy, Grindelina, Camp's Gumplant, Grindelia Weed, California Gourd, Camporeum, Campus Weed, and Campore Grindelia.  Morphologically, it is a sprawling, herbaceous perennial with hairy, branching stems and basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating.</p>

<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Common Grindelia was used by Indigenous peoples of the American Southwest, particularly the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, for centuries as a medicinal plant with diverse applications in traditional healing practices.</p>
<p> The plant, known as "yehi" by the Navajo, was valued for its anti-inflammatory and respiratory properties, often used to treat ailments such as coughs, bronchitis, and skin irritations.  In cultural rituals, Common Grindelia was sometimes incorporated into ceremonies to promote healing and spiritual balance, symbolizing resilience and connection to the land.  Traditional remedies involving the plant, such as making poultices from its leaves or preparing teas from its flowers, are still practiced today by some communities and have inspired modern herbal treatments.</p>
