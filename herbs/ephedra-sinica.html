<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ephedra sinica alkaloids are a group of organic compounds primarily responsible for the plant's medicinal properties, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine, which are structurally similar to adrenaline and exert stimulant and bronchodilator effects.</p>
<p>Ephedrine, one of the most prominent alkaloids in Ephedra sinica, acts as a central and peripheral stimulant by activating adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and bronchodilation, making it historically used in treating asthma and nasal congestion.</p>
<p>Methylamine, another constituent found in Ephedra sinica, functions as a precursor in the biosynthesis of ephedrine and contributes to the plant's overall pharmacological profile by influencing metabolic pathways and enhancing the potency of other alkaloids.</p>
<p>Norephedrine, a closely related alkaloid, shares similar pharmacological effects with ephedrine but has a slightly different chemical structure, which may influence its duration of action and therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Ephedra sinica root is primarily used for its mild stimulating and diaphoretic properties, which can help with respiratory conditions and mild cold symptoms.</p>
<p>The stem is the most commonly used part of the plant, known for its higher concentration of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, making it effective for treating bronchial asthma and nasal congestion.</p>
<p>The seed, while less commonly used, contains similar alkaloids and can be employed in formulations for similar therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from these parts include decoctions, tinctures, and powders, which are traditionally used to relieve respiratory issues and enhance circulation.</p>

<p>The 3 best medicinal parts of Ephedra sinica are shown in the image below.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="3">Side Effects of ephedra sinica</h2>
<p>Ephedra sinica heart races because it contains ephedrine, a stimulant that increases the release of adrenaline, which activates the sympathetic nervous system and accelerates heart rate.</p>
<p>Ephedra sinica increases blood pressure due to its ability to constrict blood vessels and enhance the force of heart contractions, both of which raise systemic vascular resistance.</p>
<p>Ephedra sinica causes rapid heartbeat as the stimulant effects of ephedrine directly stimulate cardiac tissue, leading to increased electrical activity in the heart.</p>
<p>Ephedra sinica can lead to sleepless nights because the stimulant properties interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night.</p>
