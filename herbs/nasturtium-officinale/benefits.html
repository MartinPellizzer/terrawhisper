<h2 id="0">1. Fights cancer cells</h2>
<p>Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.</p>
<p>This condition, also known as malignancy or neoplasia, occurs when genetic mutations disrupt normal cell regulation.</p>
<p>These mutations can result from environmental factors, lifestyle choices, or inherited genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>It commonly affects individuals across all age groups, though risk increases with age.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that nasturtium officinale may possess compounds that help fight cancer cells by inhibiting their growth and promoting apoptosis.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/nasturtium-officinale-benefits-fights-cancer-cells.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with fights cancer cells?</h2>
<p>Nasturtium officinale fights cancer cells because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which have been shown to possess anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>These compounds may inhibit the growth of cancerous cells by inducing apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress. Alkaloids like sanguinarine and flavonoids such as quercetin are known for their ability to interfere with the proliferation of malignant cells. Additionally, these compounds may suppress the formation of new blood vessels that feed tumors, thereby limiting their spread.</p>
<p>Research suggests that the synergistic effects of these bioactive compounds contribute to the plant's potential as a natural anti-cancer agent.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "PloS one", Nasturtium officinale (the plant that contains high concentrations of benzylglcosinolate) shows potential in fighting cancer cells through its hydrolysis product, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), which modulates the intracellular localization of the transcription factor FOXO1, leading to the down-regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes and the induction of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Heals wounds quickly</h2>
<p>Wound healing.</p>
<p>A condition characterized by the body's process of repairing damaged tissue, often involving inflammation, cellular proliferation, and tissue remodeling.</p>
<p>This process can be delayed or complicated by factors such as infection, poor circulation, or nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Wound healing is commonly experienced by individuals with diabetes, the elderly, or those with chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Nasturtium officinale, known for its rapid wound-healing properties, may accelerate tissue repair through its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
