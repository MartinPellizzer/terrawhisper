<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Ryania speciosa grows best in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter and a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5.  It requires full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture, though it can tolerate short periods of drought once established.  Regular watering is essential during the growing season, and mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  For optimal growth, prune dead or diseased branches annually to encourage new shoots and improve air circulation.  Harvesting should occur during the dry season when the leaves and stems are most potent, using clean, sharp shears to cut the branches just above a node, ensuring minimal damage to the plant.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation to preserve its medicinal properties, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain potency over time.</p>
