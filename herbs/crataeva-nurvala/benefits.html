<h2 id="0">1. Treats prostate issues</h2>
<p>Prostate issues refer to conditions affecting the prostate gland, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate inflammation.</p>
<p>These conditions involve the enlargement or infection of the prostate, which can lead to urinary problems and discomfort.</p>
<p>They are commonly caused by hormonal changes, age-related growth, or bacterial infections.</p>
<p>Men over the age of 40 are most likely to experience these issues, with prevalence increasing as they get older.</p>
<p>The Crataeva Nurvala plant is believed to support prostate health by reducing inflammation and promoting urinary function.</p>

<p>Overall, these bioactive components work synergistically to support the management of gout and related metabolic disorders.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to the study, Crataeva nurvala is mentioned as one of the plants that showed an antigout effect by blocking the "xanthine oxidase" enzyme, which suggests that it may reduce uric acid levels in a positive way.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Treats urinary tract</h2>
<p>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections that affect any part of the urinary system, including the bladder, kidneys, ureters, and urethra.</p>
<p>They can be caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract, often due to poor hygiene, sexual activity, or a weakened immune system.</p>
<p>Women are more commonly affected than men, and the condition is frequently seen in individuals with diabetes or those who use catheters.</p>
<p>The Crataeva nurvala plant is believed to possess antimicrobial properties that may help treat UTIs by reducing bacterial growth and inflammation in the urinary tract.</p>
<p>Its traditional use in herbal medicine suggests potential as a natural remedy for this common and often recurring health issue.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/crataeva-nurvala-benefits-treats-urinary-tract.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with treats urinary tract?</h2>
<p>Crataeva nurvala treats urinary tract because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help in reducing bacterial infection and inflammation in the urinary system. The alkaloids in the plant have been shown to exhibit diuretic effects, promoting the elimination of toxins from the body. Flavonoids contribute to the plant's ability to support urinary health by enhancing kidney function.</p>
<p>Overall, these natural compounds work synergistically to provide therapeutic benefits for urinary tract disorders.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Reduces cholesterol levels</h2>
<p>Hypercholesterolemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream, poses significant risks to cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>This metabolic disorder often results from a combination of genetic predisposition, poor dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>Individuals with a family history of heart disease or those who consume excessive saturated fats are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>The crataeva nurvala plant has been studied for its potential to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats and promoting the excretion of excess lipids.</p>
<p>Its natural compounds may offer a complementary approach to managing this condition in at-risk populations.</p>
