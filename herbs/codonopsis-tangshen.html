<p> It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is commonly known by various names including Chinese Ginseng, Codonopsis Root, Chinese Codonopsis, Chinese Bellflower, Dangshen, Codonanthes, Codonopsis Tangshen, and Codonopsis Pilosa.

<p> Its flowers are bell-shaped, typically blue or violet, and it produces capsule fruits containing small, ellipsoid seeds.</p>
<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Tangshen was used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries as a vital herb known for its ability to tonify the spleen, lungs, and stomach, making it a key component in herbal formulations for boosting energy and vitality.</p>
<p> Originating from the North China region, Tangshen has been deeply embedded in Chinese cultural practices, often featured in ancient texts such as the Shennong Bencao Jing and later in the Compendium of Materia Medica.  In folk traditions, Tangshen is associated with longevity and is sometimes used in rituals to honor ancestors or during festivals like the Lunar New Year, where it is believed to bring prosperity and health.  Traditional remedies involving Tangshen, such as decoctions for fatigue and digestive issues, remain relevant today, with modern herbalists still recommending it for its adaptogenic properties.</p>
