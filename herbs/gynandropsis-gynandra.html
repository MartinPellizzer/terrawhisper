It can be combined with other herbs, but it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional to ensure there are no adverse interactions.</p><p>While generally safe for short-term use, long-term consumption should be monitored, as there is limited research on its effects over extended periods, and it is best consumed as a tea or juiced form for optimal absorption.</p>
