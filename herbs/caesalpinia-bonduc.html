To prepare it, the seeds can be used to make tea by steeping in hot water, or a decoction can be made by boiling the dried seeds for a longer period.

It may interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding or reducing the effectiveness of these treatments.

Regular pruning and removal of dead or diseased branches help maintain its health and promote vigorous growth. The seeds are harvested when the pods turn brown and dry, typically 6 to 8 months after flowering, by carefully breaking open the pods to collect the seeds without damaging them. To preserve its potency, the seeds should be dried thoroughly in a shaded, well-ventilated area and stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Caesalpinia bonduc, commonly known as the "Java almond" or "Bengal quinine," is a medicinal plant widely used in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.
