For optimal growth, it should be planted in early spring, and regular pruning is recommended to promote bushier growth and remove dead or diseased branches. Harvesting is best done in late summer to early fall when the leaves begin to yellow, using clean shears to cut the branches just above the nodes to encourage regrowth.</p><p>After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its potency and medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Paulownia tomentosa, also known as the empress tree, is a medicinal plant valued for its potential health benefits.</p><p>It is commonly used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and many people wonder if they can grow paulownia tomentosa at home; it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation.
