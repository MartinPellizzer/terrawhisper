<p>Hedera helix terpenoids, such as aucubin and other iridoids, are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the plant's therapeutic potential in treating various ailments.</p>
<p>Hedera helix sterols, including beta-sitosterol, exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, making them valuable in managing skin conditions and reducing allergic responses.</p>
<p>Hedera helix polyphenols, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, offer strong antioxidant activity, helping to neutralize free radicals and protect cellular structures from oxidative damage.</p>
<p>Hedera helix tannins, primarily condensed tannins, possess astringent properties that aid in reducing inflammation, tightening tissues, and promoting wound healing.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of hedera helix</h2>
<p>Hedera helix leaf is commonly used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for treating respiratory conditions and skin ailments.</p>

<p>Hedera helix skin rash occurs because these compounds can penetrate the skin barrier, triggering an allergic or inflammatory response in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>Hedera helix skin irritation is commonly experienced as a result of the herb's ability to cause mechanical damage to skin cells through its crystalline structures.</p>
<p>Hedera helix eyes irritate because the same irritant compounds can become airborne and, when inhaled or contacted with the eyes, lead to redness, itching, and discomfort.</p>
