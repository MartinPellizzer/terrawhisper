<h2 id="0">1. Eases bronchitis symptoms</h2>
<p>Bronchitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the bronchial tubes, which are the airways that carry air to the lungs.</p>
<p>It can be either acute or chronic, often characterized by coughing, mucus production, and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>This condition is typically caused by viral infections, though bacterial infections or environmental irritants like smoke and pollution can also trigger it.</p>
<p>People who smoke, have asthma, or are exposed to air pollutants are more likely to experience bronchitis.</p>
<p>Adhatoda vasica plant has been traditionally used to ease bronchitis symptoms by reducing inflammation and clearing mucus from the airways.</p>
