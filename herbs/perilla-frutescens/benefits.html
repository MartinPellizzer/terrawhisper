Reduces inflammation</h2><p>Perilla frutescens reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as rosmarinic acid and perillaldehyde, which have potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These compounds work by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are involved in the inflammatory response. Studies have shown that Perilla frutescens can help alleviate symptoms of conditions such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Its anti-inflammatory effects are further supported by its ability to modulate immune responses and reduce oxidative stress.</p><p>As a result, it is widely used in traditional medicine and is gaining recognition in modern health practices for its therapeutic potential.</p><h2>3. Supports immune system</h2><p>Perilla frutescens supports immune system by providing essential nutrients and bioactive compounds that enhance the body's natural defenses.</p><p>It is rich in antioxidants such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which help neutralize harmful free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. These compounds also promote the production of immune cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, which are crucial for fighting infections. Additionally, Perilla frutescens contains vitamins C and E, which further bolster immune function by supporting the activity of white blood cells.</p><p>Regular consumption of Perilla frutescens can contribute to a stronger and more resilient immune response against pathogens.</p><h2>4. Improves heart health</h2><p>Perilla frutescens improves heart health by reducing cholesterol levels and preventing the buildup of arterial plaque.</p><p>It contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to support cardiovascular function and lower inflammation in the body. The plant also provides antioxidants that protect the heart from oxidative stress and damage. Regular consumption of Perilla frutescens may help in maintaining healthy blood pressure and improving overall circulatory function.</p><p>Its traditional use in Asian medicine further supports its role as a natural heart-protective herb.</p><h2>5. Enhances brain function</h2><p>Perilla frutescens enhances brain function due to its rich content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which supports cognitive health.</p><p>These essential fats play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of brain cells, improving memory and learning abilities. Additionally, the plant contains antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Perilla frutescens also provides omega-3 fatty acids that contribute to improved focus and mental clarity.</p><p>Overall, incorporating Perilla frutescens into the diet may support long-term brain health and enhance mental performance.</p><h2>6. Lowers cholesterol</h2><p>Perilla frutescens lowers cholesterol by containing compounds like gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and phytosterols, which help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.</p><p>These bioactive components work by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines and promoting its excretion from the body. Studies have shown that regular consumption of Perilla frutescens can lead to significant improvements in blood lipid profiles. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties further support cardiovascular health.</p><p>As a result, incorporating Perilla frutescens into the diet may be a natural and effective way to manage cholesterol levels.</p><h2>7. Promotes skin health</h2><p>Perilla frutescens promotes skin health due to its rich content of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds.</p><p>It contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and support the skin's natural barrier function. The plant also provides antioxidants like vitamin C and flavonoids that combat oxidative stress and prevent premature aging. These properties make it effective in treating skin conditions such as acne and eczema.</p><p>Regular use of Perilla frutescens in skincare routines can enhance overall skin vitality and appearance.</p><h2>8.
