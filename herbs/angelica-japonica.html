<h2 id="1">Scientific and Botanical Profile</h2><p>Japanese Angelica, with botanical name Angelica japonica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family.</p>
<p> It is native to regions such as Japan, Korea, China, Eastern Siberia, Taiwan, Mongolia, Russian Far East, North Korea, South Korea, Yakutia, Primorsky Krai, and Hokkaido.  Morphologically, it is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring hollow, ridged stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive parsley-like aroma.  The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which later develop into small, dry fruits.</p>
<p> Common names for this plant include Japanese Angelica, Angelica Root, Japanese Angelica Root, Japanese Angelica, Tangzhi, Japanese Angelicas, Japanese Hogweed, Goshoyu, Yuzen, Yamabuki, and Common Angelica, reflecting its cultural and medicinal significance across various regions.</p>
<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Japanese Angelica was used in traditional Japanese medicine for centuries, valued for its purported ability to promote vitality and treat ailments such as coughs and digestive issues.</p>
<p> It has deep roots in Shinto and Buddhist practices, where it was often associated with purification and spiritual protection, and was used in rituals to cleanse spaces and ward off evil spirits.  In folk traditions, the plant was also believed to bring good fortune and was sometimes included in offerings during festivals or placed near homes for protection.  Today, its roots and seeds are still used in herbal remedies, with some traditional formulations targeting respiratory health and menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p> The plant remains a symbol of cultural heritage, reflecting the deep connection between nature and well-being in Japanese culture.</p>
<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Japanese Angelica contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and terpenes, which contribute to its medicinal properties.</p>
<p> It is also rich in vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin A, and various B-complex vitamins, along with minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron.  The plant's high antioxidant content helps neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress in the body.  Its essential oils, particularly those containing compounds like ligustilide and camphor, may support respiratory and digestive health by acting as mild spasmolytics and anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
<p> These components work synergistically to enhance immune function and promote overall wellness.</p>
<h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2><p>Angelica japonica has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and circulatory benefits, making it particularly beneficial for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.</p>
<p> It is known to support heart health by improving blood flow and reducing cholesterol levels, while also helping to alleviate symptoms of asthma and bronchitis due to its bronchodilatory effects.  Compared to similar herbs like angelica sinensis, angelica japonica offers a more pronounced effect on the circulatory system and exhibits higher potency in reducing inflammation, making it a preferred choice for those seeking stronger therapeutic outcomes.  Additionally, it supports the digestive system by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and may aid in detoxification processes.</p>

<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Angelica japonica can be used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, but it is important to be aware of its safety profile.</p>

<p>0 to 7. 5.  It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture, especially during its growing season, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.

The plant is typically harvested in the fall when the stalks have matured and the leaves have turned yellow, using a sharp knife to cut the entire plant at ground level.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the harvested plant is dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its medicinal properties.</p>
