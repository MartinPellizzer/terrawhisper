<h2 id="0">1. Treats prostate issues</h2>
<p>Prostatic hyperplasia, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or enlarged prostate, is a common condition in older men.</p>
<p>It involves the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to urinary difficulties such as frequent urination, weak urine flow, and nighttime urination.</p>
<p>This condition is primarily caused by hormonal changes, particularly the imbalance between estrogen and testosterone, as men age.</p>
<p>It commonly affects men over the age of 50, with prevalence increasing as they grow older.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum, also known as African teak, has been traditionally used to support prostate health and may help alleviate symptoms associated with this condition.</p>
