<p> It is commonly known by various names such as Kalmegh, Indian Snakeroot, Malabar Nut, Karanj, Vasaka, Bael Tree, Velvet Leaf, Lakoocha, Karanja, Indian Pennywort, Balloon Vine, Hemlock, Indian Trumpet, and Kapikachhu.  Morphologically, Adhatoda vasica is a herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered with a velvety texture.</p>
<p> It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters, and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>
<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Adhatoda was used in traditional Indian medicine for centuries, particularly in Ayurveda, where it is known as Vasaka and valued for its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p> It has a long history of use in treating respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and coughs, with its leaves and seeds being utilized in various formulations.  In rural communities, Adhatoda is still employed in folk remedies, often prepared as a decoction or paste to alleviate throat infections and digestive issues.  The plant holds cultural significance in some regions, where it is sometimes incorporated into rituals or used as a symbol of healing and renewal.</p>
<p> Its enduring presence in both traditional and modern medicinal practices underscores its relevance in preserving health and wellness across generations.</p>
<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Adhatoda contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids such as vasicine, ajmaline, and tetrahydroalstonine, which are known for their pharmacological properties.</p>
<p> It also contains flavonoids, terpenes, and essential oils that contribute to its therapeutic effects.  The plant is rich in antioxidants, vitamins like vitamin C, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which support overall health.  These compounds work synergistically to exert anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, and antimicrobial effects by modulating cellular signaling pathways and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
<p> Its unique chemical composition makes it a valuable herb in traditional and modern medicine for treating respiratory and inflammatory conditions.</p>
<h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2><p>Adhatoda vasica has been widely recognized for its medicinal properties and health benefits, particularly in supporting respiratory, digestive, and cardiovascular systems.</p>
<p> It is known for its ability to alleviate respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma due to its expectorant and antispasmodic effects, while also improving digestion by stimulating the secretion of digestive enzymes.  Compared to similar herbs like Malabar nut (Spondias pinnata), Adhatoda vasica offers more potent bronchodilatory effects and a broader spectrum of therapeutic actions.  Its unique advantage lies in its ability to not only clear mucus but also strengthen lung function, making it more effective for chronic respiratory ailments.</p>

<p> To prepare it, it can be made into a tea by steeping the dried leaves in hot water, or a decoction can be made by boiling the plant parts for a longer period.  It can also be used as an infusion or applied topically for skin conditions.  The recommended dosage for adults is typically 2-4 grams of the dried powder per day, divided into two or three doses, while children should only use it under medical supervision.</p>
<p> Due to its potency, it is advisable to use adhatoda vasica sparingly and for short durations, unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Adhatoda vasica can be used with caution due to its potential side effects and interactions, making it important to consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> Common side effects may include gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and allergic reactions, while more severe effects such as liver toxicity have been reported in some cases.  It may interact with medications like antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and antidiabetics, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing adverse effects.  During pregnancy and breastfeeding, adhatoda vasica is generally not recommended due to limited safety data and potential risks to the fetus or infant.  For chronic illness patients, especially those with liver or kidney disease, it should be used under medical supervision.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, always follow recommended dosages, avoid long-term use without medical guidance, and monitor for any adverse reactions.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Adhatoda vasica grows best in well-drained loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, in full sun to partial shade, and requires regular watering to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p> It thrives in warm climates and benefits from occasional fertilization during the growing season to promote healthy foliage and stem development.  Regular pruning of dead or damaged leaves and monitoring for pests like aphids and leaf-eating insects are essential for maintaining plant vigor.  Harvesting is best done during the dry season, when the leaves and stems are most potent, using clean cutting tools to collect the plant material without damaging the root system.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant parts should be dried in a cool, shaded area to preserve their medicinal properties, then stored in airtight containers away from moisture and light to maintain potency over time.</p>
