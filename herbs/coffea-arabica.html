<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of coffea arabica</h2>
<p>Coffea arabica caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that acts as an antagonist to adenosine receptors, thereby increasing alertness, reducing fatigue, and enhancing metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica chlorogenic acid is a group of phenolic compounds that contribute to the bean's antioxidant properties and may influence glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica theobromine is a methylxanthine similar to caffeine, known for its mild stimulant effects, vasodilatory properties, and potential role in cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica quinic acid is a organic acid that contributes to the bean's flavor profile and may play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of coffea arabica</h2>
<p>Coffea arabica teas are commonly prepared by steeping dried coffee beans or ground coffee in hot water, resulting in a rich, aromatic beverage that is widely consumed for its flavor and potential stimulant effects due to caffeine content.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica decoctions involve boiling the beans or leaves for an extended period to extract more complex compounds, often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and digestive properties.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the plant material in alcohol, which is believed to enhance the bioavailability of active compounds and is used in some herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica syrups are made by simmering the plant with sugar and water, creating a sweet, aromatic preparation that is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported soothing and energizing effects.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of coffea arabica</h2>
<p>Coffea arabica causes insomnia because the caffeine it contains stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and making it difficult to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica leads to anxiety because caffeine increases the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which can heighten feelings of worry and restlessness.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica induces headaches because caffeine constricts blood vessels in the brain, which can trigger migraines or tension headaches in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>Coffea arabica leads to sleep disturbances because it disrupts the natural sleep-wake cycle by inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep.</p>
