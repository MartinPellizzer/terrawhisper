<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of sassafras albidum</h2>
<p>Sassafras albidum root is a key medicinal part of the sassafras plant, historically valued for its aromatic and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The root contains compounds like safrole, which has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from the root include root tea, tinctures, and poultices, which were traditionally used to treat ailments such as rheumatism and digestive issues.</p>
<p>However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, modern usage of sassafras root is limited and regulated.</p>
