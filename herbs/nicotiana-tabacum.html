<h2 id="4">Side Effects of nicotiana tabacum</h2>
<p>Nicotiana tabacum causes coughing fits because the irritant chemicals in tobacco smoke, such as nicotine and tar, inflame the airways and stimulate the cough reflex.</p>
<p>Nicotiana tabacum promotes lung damage because prolonged exposure to these harmful substances leads to the destruction of lung tissue and impairs the function of cilia that help clear mucus and debris from the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Nicotiana tabacum causes addiction because nicotine, a potent stimulant, activates the brain's reward system, leading to increased dopamine levels and creating a dependency that is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Nicotiana tabacum leads to breathing issues because it narrows the airways, reduces lung capacity, and increases mucus production, making it harder to breathe efficiently.</p>

<p>Below you find a list of the 7 most common health side effects of Nicotiana tabacum.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Causes Coughing Fits</strong>: Regular use of Nicotiana tabacum can irritate the respiratory system, leading to frequent and persistent coughing fits.</li>
<li><strong>Promotes Lung Damage</strong>: The harmful chemicals in Nicotiana tabacum can cause inflammation and scarring in the lungs, leading to severe lung damage over time.</li>
<li><strong>Causes Addiction</strong>: Nicotiana tabacum contains nicotine, a highly addictive substance that leads to dependence and withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped.</li>
<li><strong>Leads To Breathing Issues</strong>: The inhalation of Nicotiana tabacum smoke can impair lung function and cause difficulty in breathing, especially in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Results In Nausea</strong>: The nicotine and other toxic compounds in Nicotiana tabacum can irritate the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting in some individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Induces Throat Irritation</strong>: The smoke from Nicotiana tabacum can irritate the throat lining, causing inflammation, soreness, and a persistent feeling of throat discomfort.</li>
