<h2 id="0">1. Improves skin texture</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica improves skin texture because it contains bioactive constituents such as asiatic acid, madecassic acid, and centellic acid, which promote collagen synthesis and skin regeneration.</p>
<p>These compounds help in reducing scarring, enhancing skin elasticity, and improving overall skin appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is particularly beneficial for conditions like acne scars, stretch marks, and eczema.</p>
<p>It is also used to alleviate symptoms of psoriasis and rosacea due to its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Protects against oxidation</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica protects against oxidation because it contains bioactive constituents such as asiatic acid, madecassic acid, and centellic acid, which act as antioxidants.</p>
<p>These compounds neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This health benefit can help alleviate conditions like skin inflammation, wound healing issues, and even neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>It is also beneficial for improving circulation and supporting overall cellular health.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Supports wound healing</h2>
