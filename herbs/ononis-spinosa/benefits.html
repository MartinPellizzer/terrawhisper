<h2 id="8">9. Prevents urinary tract</h2>
<p>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are bacterial infections that affect any part of the urinary system, including the bladder, kidneys, ureters, or urethra.</p>
<p>Also known as urinary tract infections, these conditions can cause discomfort, pain, and frequent urination.</p>
<p>They are commonly caused by the growth of bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, which enters the urinary tract through the urethra.</p>
<p>Women are more susceptible to UTIs due to their shorter urethra, and individuals with weakened immune systems or certain medical conditions are also at higher risk.</p>
<p>The ononis spinosa plant has been traditionally used to support urinary health and may help prevent UTIs by promoting a balanced microbial environment in the urinary tract.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/ononis-spinosa-benefits-prevents-urinary-tract.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
