<p>Solidago canadensis heals wounds faster because it contains compounds that stimulate collagen synthesis and enhance the activity of fibroblasts, which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration.</p>
<p>Solidago canadensis fights bacterial infections due to its antimicrobial properties, which are attributed to the presence of compounds like arctigenin and other phytochemicals that disrupt bacterial cell membranes and inhibit their growth.</p>
<p>Solidago canadensis reduces inflammation quickly because its active constituents modulate inflammatory pathways, including the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are key in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins.</p>
