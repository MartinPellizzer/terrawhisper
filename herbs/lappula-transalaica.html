                <h1>Lappula Transalaica</h1><p>Lappula transalica, also known as Transylvanian milkvetch, is a traditional medicinal plant used in folk medicine for its purported health benefits.</p><p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in parts of Romania and the Balkans, where it has been historically valued for its therapeutic properties. The plant is believed to support liver function and aid in detoxification processes within the body. Its use often involves preparing tinctures or decoctions from its leaves and roots, which are thought to promote digestion and reduce inflammation.</p><p>Although scientific research on its medicinal effects is limited, it remains an important herb in traditional healing practices across several European countries.</p>
