<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Pedicularis densiflora grows in cool, moist environments such as forested areas or mountainous regions where it receives partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter.</p>
<p> It thrives in temperatures between 10°C and 20°C, requiring consistent moisture but avoiding waterlogged conditions.  To ensure healthy growth, it should be planted in early spring after the last frost, with regular watering and mulching to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  For optimal care, avoid over-fertilizing, as this can damage the delicate roots, and regularly check for pests like aphids or fungal infections.  Harvesting should occur in late summer to early autumn when the flowers are fully open, using clean, sharp shears to cut the stems just below the flower buds, ensuring minimal damage to the plant.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the flowers should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area to preserve their potency, then stored in airtight glass containers or sealed plastic bags in a cool, dark place to maintain their medicinal properties.</p>
