<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Trillium erectum reduces pain symptoms due to its ability to modulate pain pathways in the nervous system and inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to chronic pain.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as triterpenoids and alkaloids that inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It is anti-inflammatory because these compounds also suppress the activity of enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase, which are involved in the inflammatory response. It is antioxidant rich due to the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids that neutralize free radicals and prevent oxidative stress in cells.</p>
<p>It is anti-cancerous because some of its compounds may induce apoptosis in cancer cells and inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells through various molecular mechanisms.</p>
