                <h1>Catha Edulis</h1><p>Catha edulis, commonly known as khat, is a plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and has been traditionally used for its stimulant properties.</p><p>The leaves of Catha edulis contain psychoactive alkaloids, primarily cathine and cathinone, which act on the central nervous system to produce effects similar to those of amphetamines. In many cultures, it has been used for its perceived medicinal benefits, including treating fatigue, improving concentration, and alleviating symptoms of depression. However, its use is controversial due to potential addictive properties and health risks associated with chronic consumption.</p><p>Despite these concerns, some traditional medical practices still incorporate Catha edulis for its purported therapeutic effects.</p>
