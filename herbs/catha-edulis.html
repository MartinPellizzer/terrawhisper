<h2 id="0">Health Benefits of catha edulis</h2>
<p>Catha edulis reduces stress levels by containing active compounds such as cathine and cathinone, which act on the central nervous system to stimulate the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, thereby promoting a sense of calm and reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>Catha edulis treats insomnia disorder due to its ability to modulate the brain's sleep-wake cycle, enhancing alertness during the day and promoting deeper relaxation at night, which helps in falling asleep more easily.</p>
<p>Catha edulis improves sleep quality by influencing the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which plays a key role in managing the body's stress response and maintaining a balanced sleep pattern.</p>
<p>Catha edulis increases energy levels by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system and enhancing metabolic activity, which leads to improved alertness and a heightened sense of physical and mental vigor.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of catha edulis</h2>
<p>Catha edulis cardiac glycosides are a group of naturally occurring compounds that exhibit potent inotropic effects, enhancing cardiac contractility by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme, which leads to increased intracellular calcium levels and stronger heart contractions.</p>
<p>Catha edulis contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, thereby increasing alertness, reducing fatigue, and elevating mood by enhancing the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>The phenolic acids present in Catha edulis possess antioxidant properties that help neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress, and may contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>Theobromine, another alkaloid found in Catha edulis, functions as a vasodilator and bronchodilator, promoting relaxation of smooth muscle in the airways and blood vessels, which can improve respiratory function and cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of catha edulis</h2>
<p>Catha edulis leaf is the most commonly used part of the plant, known for its stimulating effects due to the presence of cathinone and cathine.</p>
<p>The leaf is typically chewed or brewed into a tea, and it is also used to make poultices for topical applications.</p>
<p>The root of Catha edulis is less frequently used but can be prepared into decoctions or tinctures for internal use, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to the leaf.</p>
<p>The fruit of Catha edulis is rarely utilized in traditional medicine, but when used, it may be dried and ground into a powder or incorporated into herbal mixtures for specific therapeutic purposes.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of catha edulis</h2>
<p>Catha edulis increases heart rate due to its stimulant properties, which activate the central nervous system and release adrenaline, leading to a faster cardiac rhythm.</p>
<p>The herb causes insomnia because it elevates alertness and suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone essential for regulating sleep cycles.</p>
<p>Catha edulis causes dry mouth as it reduces saliva production, likely due to its anticholinergic effects that inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>The herb increases blood pressure because it constricts blood vessels and enhances cardiac output, both of which place additional strain on the cardiovascular system.</p>
