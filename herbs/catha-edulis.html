<li><strong>Flavonoids</strong>: Flavonoids are a group of plant-based compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential cardiovascular benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Flavonoid Glycosides</strong>: Flavonoid glycosides are flavonoids bound to sugar molecules, often contributing to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of plants.</li>
<li><strong>Quinic Acid</strong>: Quinic acid is a natural organic acid that acts as an antioxidant and may help in reducing inflammation and supporting metabolic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Terpenes</strong>: Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds that often contribute to the aroma and flavor of plants, and may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</li>
<li><strong>Alkaloids</strong>: Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing compounds that often have significant physiological effects on humans and animals, including stimulant, sedative, and analgesic properties.</li>
<li><strong>Saponins</strong>: Saponins are plant-derived compounds that can act as surfactants, and may have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol-lowering effects.</li>
</ol>
