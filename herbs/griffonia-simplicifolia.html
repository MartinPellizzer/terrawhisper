This makes Griffonia a popular supplement for supporting mood regulation, sleep quality, and overall mental well-being. Additionally, it is used in traditional medicine to address anxiety, depression, and insomnia due to its calming effects.</p><p>Its natural origin and potential neuroprotective benefits have also led to research exploring its applications in managing conditions like Parkinson's disease and migraines.</p>
