<p> For internal use, it can be prepared as a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or as a decoction by simmering the plant material for a longer period, while an infusion involves using cold or room temperature water for a gentler extraction.  Topical preparations, such as salves or oils, are commonly used for skin conditions and minor ailments.  The recommended dosage for adults is typically 1 to 2 grams of dried herb per cup of water, taken up to three times daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision.</p>

<p> To ensure safe use, consult a healthcare provider before use, follow recommended dosages, and discontinue use if adverse effects occur.</p>

<p>5 to 7. 5, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.  It requires consistent moisture during the growing season but should not be overwatered to prevent root rot, and it thrives in temperate climates with mild winters.  Regular weeding and occasional pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for maintaining plant health and promoting essential oil production.  Harvesting is best done in late summer to early autumn when the plant's essential oils are most concentrated, using sharp shears to cut the flowering tops just above the leaves.</p>
<p> To preserve its potency, the harvested material should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight glass containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain its medicinal properties.</p>
