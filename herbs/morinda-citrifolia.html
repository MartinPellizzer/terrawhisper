<p> To minimize risks, start with small doses, monitor for adverse reactions, and always use it under professional guidance.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Morinda citrifolia grows best in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter and has a pH between 5.</p>
<p>5 and 7. 0, with full sun exposure to ensure optimal growth and fruit development.  It requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.  Regular pruning and mulching help maintain plant health, while monitoring for pests like aphids and fruit flies is essential for successful cultivation.  Harvesting is best done when the fruits turn a deep red or orange color, typically 6 to 8 months after flowering, using a sharp knife or shears to cut the fruit from the stem.</p>
<p> For storage, the fruits should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area to preserve potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to extend shelf life.</p>
