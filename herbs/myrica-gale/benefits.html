<p>Myrica gale supports immune system because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help enhance the body's natural defenses by stimulating the production of white blood cells. The presence of these phytochemicals also aids in reducing oxidative stress, which can weaken immune function. Additionally, flavonoids in Myrica gale may modulate immune responses by interacting with various signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Overall, the combination of these bioactive compounds contributes to its immune-boosting effects.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Treats respiratory issues</h2>
<p>Respiratory Issues, also known as breathing disorders or lung-related ailments, refer to conditions that affect the normal function of the respiratory system.</p>
<p>These issues can be caused by infections, allergies, environmental irritants, or chronic conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>They are commonly experienced by individuals with weakened immune systems, smokers, or those exposed to polluted air.</p>
<p>Myrica gale plant is believed to help treat these ailments by reducing inflammation and easing breathing.</p>
<p>Its traditional use in herbal medicine highlights its potential role in supporting respiratory health.</p>
