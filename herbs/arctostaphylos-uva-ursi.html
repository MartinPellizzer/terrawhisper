<h2 id="0">Health Benefits of arctostaphylos uva-ursi</h2>
<p>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi fights urinary tract infections due to its high concentration of arbutin, a glycoside that is converted into hydroquinone in the body, which has antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria like Escherichia coli, a common cause of UTIs.</p>
<p>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi reduces bacterial growth because the hydroquinone it produces disrupts bacterial cell walls and interferes with their ability to replicate, thereby limiting their spread in the urinary tract.</p>
<p>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi prevents UTI recurrence by maintaining a balanced microbial environment in the urinary tract and reducing inflammation, which helps prevent the re-establishment of harmful bacterial colonies.</p>
