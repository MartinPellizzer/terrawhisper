<p>Harpagophytum procumbens reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as harpagide and harpagoside, which inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes like COX-2 and reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>It treats arthritis symptoms due to its ability to modulate the immune response and decrease joint swelling and pain, making it a natural alternative for managing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. It lowers anxiety levels by interacting with the central nervous system and increasing the availability of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and GABA, which regulate mood and emotional balance. It improves sleep quality by promoting relaxation and reducing nighttime awakenings, possibly through its calming effects on the nervous system and its influence on melatonin production.</p>
<p>It reduces stress hormones such as cortisol by supporting the body's stress response mechanisms and enhancing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p>
