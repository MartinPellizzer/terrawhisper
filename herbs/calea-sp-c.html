<p> c can be used as a medicinal plant for its potential therapeutic effects, but it should be approached with caution due to its possible safety concerns.

<p> For safe use, it is recommended to consult a qualified herbalist or healthcare professional, start with small doses, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Calea sp.</p>
<p> c grows in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter, preferring a slightly acidic to neutral pH.  It thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily, and benefits from consistent moisture without becoming waterlogged.  Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, but care should be taken to avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.  For optimal growth, mulching around the base of the plant helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.  Pruning spent flowers and dead foliage throughout the growing season encourages new growth and maintains the plant's vigor.  

Harvesting should occur in the early morning or late afternoon when the plant's essential oils are most concentrated, typically between late summer and early autumn.  The leaves and flowers are best collected by hand, using clean shears to avoid damaging the plant, and should be harvested before the plant begins to flower excessively.  To preserve potency, the harvested parts should be shade-dried in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight, then stored in airtight glass jars or sealed containers in a cool, dark, and dry place.</p>
<p> For long-term storage, some herbalists recommend refrigeration or freezing to maintain potency and prevent degradation.</p>
