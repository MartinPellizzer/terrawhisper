Alkamides, in particular, are known to modulate the production of cytokines, which play a crucial role in inflammatory responses. Polysaccharides, on the other hand, support the body's natural defenses by promoting the proliferation of white blood cells.</p><p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Echinacea angustifolia a valuable herb in the treatment of respiratory infections and immune support.</p><h2>Medicinal Preparations</h2><p>Echinacea angustifolia has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and capsules, which are commonly used to support immune function.</p><p>These preparations often contain the plantâ€™s aerial parts, including leaves and flowers, which are rich in active compounds like alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, and polysaccharides. Teas are made by steeping dried parts in hot water, while tinctures involve soaking the plant material in alcohol to extract its bioactive components. Capsules provide a convenient and standardized form of the herb for daily use.</p><p>Due to its anti-inflammatory and immunostimulant properties, Echinacea angustifolia is widely utilized in herbal medicine for preventing and treating colds and respiratory infections.</p><h2>Side Effects</h2><p>Echinacea angustifolia can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, particularly in individuals sensitive to herbal supplements.</p><p>Allergic reactions may also occur, especially in people with pollen allergies, as Echinacea is related to the daisy family.
