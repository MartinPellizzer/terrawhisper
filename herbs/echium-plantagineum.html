                <h1>Echium Plantagineum</h1><p>Echium plantagineum, commonly known as viper's bugloss, has been traditionally used for its potential medicinal properties.</p><p>It contains bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and mucilage, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antispasmodic effects. In herbal medicine, it has been employed to treat respiratory conditions like coughs and bronchitis, as well as digestive issues such as ulcers and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that Echium plantagineum may also support cardiovascular health by improving blood circulation and reducing cholesterol levels.</p><p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential and ensure its safe use in modern medicine.</p>
