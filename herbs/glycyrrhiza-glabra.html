<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra treats ulcers effectively because it contains compounds like glycyrrhizin that protect the stomach lining by neutralizing harmful bacteria like Helicobacter pylori and promoting the production of mucus that shields the stomach from acid.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra eases coughs quickly because it has expectorant and soothing effects that help loosen mucus in the airways and reduce irritation in the throat.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra treats skin problems due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties, which can help with conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and acne by reducing infection and inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of glycyrrhiza glabra</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra glycyrrhizin is a triterpene glycoside that acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent, primarily due to its ability to modulate the immune system and inhibit the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra saponins, which include various triterpene glycosides, exhibit anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, and antimicrobial properties by disrupting cell membranes and enhancing the body's immune response.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra triterpenoids, such as beta-amyrin and lupeol, contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective effects by inhibiting inflammatory pathways and protecting liver cells from damage.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra lipids, including oils and fatty acids, provide emollient properties that support skin health and may aid in the absorption of other active compounds within the herb.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of glycyrrhiza glabra</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra root is the primary medicinal part of the licorice plant, known for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and expectorant properties.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from the root include decoctions, tinctures, syrups, and powders, which are widely used in both conventional and complementary medicine.</p>
<p>These preparations are often employed to treat respiratory conditions, digestive issues, and skin ailments.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of glycyrrhiza glabra</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried root in hot water, resulting in a flavorful and aromatic beverage known for its potential anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra decoctions involve boiling the root for a longer period, extracting more potent compounds and often used for digestive or respiratory support.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the root in alcohol, offering a more potent form of the herb for targeted therapeutic use.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra lozenges are formulated with the herb to provide a convenient and effective way to soothe sore throats and support respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of glycyrrhiza glabra</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra causes fluid retention because it contains glycyrrhizin, which acts as a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, mimicking the effects of aldosterone and promoting sodium retention in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra induces potassium loss because the same mechanism that retains sodium also increases the excretion of potassium through the kidneys, leading to hypokalemia.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra leads to high blood pressure because the sodium retention and potassium loss disrupt the body's fluid balance, increasing blood volume and vascular resistance.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra causes stomach ulcers because its active compounds can irritate the gastric mucosa and reduce the protective mucus layer, making the stomach lining more susceptible to acid damage.</p>
