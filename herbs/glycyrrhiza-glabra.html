<h2 id="3">Side Effects of glycyrrhiza glabra</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra causes fluid retention because it contains glycyrrhizin, which acts as a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, mimicking the effects of aldosterone and promoting sodium retention in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra induces potassium loss because the same mechanism that retains sodium also increases the excretion of potassium through the kidneys, leading to hypokalemia.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra leads to high blood pressure because the sodium retention and potassium loss disrupt the body's fluid balance, increasing blood volume and vascular resistance.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra causes stomach ulcers because its active compounds can irritate the gastric mucosa and reduce the protective mucus layer, making the stomach lining more susceptible to acid damage.</p>

<p>The 9 most common side effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra are shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="/images/herbs/glycyrrhiza-glabra-side-effects.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>The list below give a brief description of the 9 most common side effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Causes Fluid Retention</strong>: Glycyrrhiza glabra can lead to fluid retention due to its effect on mineralocorticoid receptors, which can cause the body to retain sodium and water.</li>
<li><strong>Induces Potassium Loss</strong>: The herb may cause potassium loss by increasing the excretion of potassium through urine, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances.</li>
<li><strong>Leads To High Blood Pressure</strong>: The herb's effect on fluid retention and potassium levels can contribute to an increase in blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Causes Stomach Ulcers</strong>: Glycyrrhiza glabra may irritate the stomach lining and reduce the protective mucus layer, increasing the risk of ulcers.</li>
<li><strong>Causes Digestive Upset</strong>: The herb can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Causes Weight Gain</strong>: Fluid retention and changes in metabolism associated with Glycyrrhiza glabra may contribute to weight gain in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Causes Sweating</strong>: The herb may stimulate the body's thermoregulatory system, leading to increased sweating as a side effect.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers Heart Palpitations</strong>: The herb's impact on electrolyte balance and blood pressure can sometimes result in irregular heartbeats or palpitations.</li>
<li><strong>Leads To Muscle Weakness</strong>: Potassium loss and other electrolyte imbalances caused by Glycyrrhiza glabra may result in muscle weakness and fatigue.</li>
