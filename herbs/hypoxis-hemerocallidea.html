Modern research suggests that Hypoxis may help enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells, making it a potential aid in combating infections and chronic illnesses. The plant's active compounds, such as hypoxoside and other polysaccharides, are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p><p>Due to its growing popularity, Hypoxis is increasingly being studied for its potential role in complementary and alternative medicine.</p>
