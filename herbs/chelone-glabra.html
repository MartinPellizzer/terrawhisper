It soothes skin by possessing anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help reduce redness, irritation, and infection, making it effective for treating conditions like eczema and psoriasis. It reduces inflammation by inhibiting the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), which are involved in the production of inflammatory mediators.</p>
<p>It kills bacteria by containing bioactive compounds that disrupt bacterial cell membranes and interfere with essential metabolic processes, making it a natural antimicrobial agent.</p>
