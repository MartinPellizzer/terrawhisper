<p>Prunus serotina saponins are glycoside compounds that possess surfactant properties, which can enhance the absorption of nutrients and may have antimicrobial and antifungal effects by disrupting cell membranes of pathogens.</p>
<p>Prunus serotina phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid and ferulic acid, are known for their strong antioxidant properties, which help protect cells from oxidative stress and may contribute to the herb's potential in supporting cardiovascular and digestive health.</p>
