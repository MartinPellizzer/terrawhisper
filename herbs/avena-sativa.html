<p>Avena sativa leads to gas because the fiber can ferment in the gut, producing gases like methane and hydrogen as a byproduct of bacterial digestion.</p>
<p>Avena sativa causes stomach upset due to its high fiber content, which may irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, especially in individuals with sensitive digestion.</p>
