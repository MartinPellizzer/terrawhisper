<h2 id="0">Health Benefits of vaccinium vitis-idaea</h2>
<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea eases inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, which inhibit the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), thereby reducing the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</p>
<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea boosts the immune system due to its high concentration of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds that stimulate the production of immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes, enhancing the body's ability to combat infections and pathogens.</p>
<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea fights oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals through its rich content of polyphenols and anthocyanins, which neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect cellular structures from damage.</p>
<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea lowers blood pressure by improving endothelial function and promoting vasodilation through the release of nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels and reduces vascular resistance.</p>
