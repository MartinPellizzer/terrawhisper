</ol>
<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Salvia divinorum salvinorin a is the primary psychoactive constituent responsible for the herb's hallucinogenic effects, acting as a potent kappa opioid receptor agonist.</p>
<p>While salvinorin a is the most well-known and studied compound, other related compounds such as salvinorin b and salvinorin c also exist within the plant, though they are less understood and have not been extensively researched for their pharmacological properties. Rosmarinic acid, another compound found in Salvia divinorum, is a polyphenolic antioxidant that may contribute to the plant's potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. These compounds collectively play a role in the plant's traditional use in spiritual and ceremonial contexts, as well as its modern interest in scientific research.</p>
<p>However, the full therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of these constituents remain areas of ongoing investigation, highlighting the complex biochemical profile of Salvia divinorum.</p>

<p>The 7 best bioactive constituents of Salvia divinorum are shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="/images/herbs/salvia-divinorum-constituents.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>The list below give a brief description of the 9 best bioactive constituents of Salvia divinorum.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Salvinorin A</strong>: A potent psychoactive alkaloid known for its strong hallucinogenic effects and used in traditional spiritual practices.</li>
<li><strong>Salvinorin B</strong>: A secondary psychoactive compound found in Salvia divinorum, with similar effects to salvinorin A but less potent.</li>
<li><strong>Rosmarinic Acid</strong>: A polyphenolic compound with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties.</li>
<li><strong>Salvinorin C</strong>: A lesser-known alkaloid with potential pharmacological effects, though less studied compared to salvinorin A and B.</li>
<li><strong>Salvinorin D</strong>: Another alkaloid found in the plant, with limited research on its specific effects and mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Salvianolic Acid A</strong>: A water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties and potential anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
<li><strong>Salvianolic Acid B</strong>: A compound known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the overall health benefits of the herb.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Salvia divinorum leaf is one of the primary medicinal parts of this plant, known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of the compound DMT.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested when they are fully mature, as this is when the concentration of active compounds is highest. In traditional use, the leaves are often chewed or brewed into a tea, allowing the active ingredients to be absorbed through the oral mucosa. This method of consumption is believed to produce a more intense and prolonged effect compared to other forms of ingestion.</p>
<p>The leaf's medicinal use extends beyond its psychoactive effects, as some studies suggest it may have potential in treating pain, anxiety, and even depression, though more research is needed to confirm these benefits.</p>

<p>The 2 best medicinal parts of Salvia divinorum are shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="/images/herbs/salvia-divinorum-parts.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">

</ol>
<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Salvia divinorum tinctures are a popular method of consuming the plant's psychoactive compounds, particularly the alkaloid DMT.</p>
<p>These tinctures are typically made by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol, which extracts the active components for later use. Users often take a small amount of the tincture under the tongue for rapid absorption into the bloodstream, leading to a quick onset of effects. Tinctures offer a concentrated form of the herb, allowing for precise dosing and a more controlled experience compared to other methods.</p>
<p>In contrast, Salvia divinorum capsules provide a more convenient and discreet option for consumption. The dried plant material is encapsulated, making it easy to take with water or other liquids. Capsules are especially favored by individuals who prefer not to handle the liquid form or who want to avoid the taste of alcohol. Both tinctures and capsules are commonly used in spiritual and ceremonial contexts, as well as for personal exploration.</p>
<p>However, due to the potent nature of Salvia divinorum, it is crucial to use these preparations responsibly and in accordance with local laws and guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of salvia divinorum</h2>
<p>Salvia divinorum heart races quickly due to the herb's active compound, salvinorin A, which interacts with kappa opioid receptors in the brain, leading to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and a rise in heart rate.</p>
<p>Salvia divinorum body shakes violently as the same receptor interaction can cause heightened anxiety and autonomic nervous system stimulation, resulting in tremors and muscle spasms. Salvia divinorum head spins rapidly because the psychoactive effects can disrupt the inner ear's balance mechanisms, leading to vertigo and a sensation of spinning.</p>
<p>Salvia divinorum legs feel weak as the herb's effects on the central nervous system can impair motor coordination and cause muscle relaxation, leading to a loss of strength and stability.</p>
