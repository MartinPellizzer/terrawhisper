<h2 id="0">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Salvia divinorum leaf and flower are the primary medicinal parts of this plant, known for their psychoactive and potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested when fully mature, while the flowers are often collected during their blooming period, which occurs in late summer.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from these parts include infusions, tinctures, and smokable blends, with the leaves being more commonly used due to their higher concentration of the active alkaloid, DMT.</p>
<p>The flowers, while less frequently used, can also be infused or dried for later use in similar preparations.</p>

<p>Salvia divinorum decoctions involve boiling the leaves for an extended period to release more potent compounds, leading to a stronger and more intense experience, though this method is less common due to its complexity and potential for overconsumption.</p>
