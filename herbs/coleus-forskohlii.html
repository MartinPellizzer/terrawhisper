<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Coleus forskohlii reduces blood pressure by increasing the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which relaxes blood vessel walls and improves blood flow, thereby lowering systemic vascular resistance.</p>
<p>It helps manage glucose by enhancing the activity of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as adenylate cyclase, which promotes the uptake of glucose into cells. It improves insulin sensitivity by modulating signaling pathways that enhance the body's response to insulin, making cells more receptive to insulin's effects. It improves cognitive function by increasing cAMP levels in the brain, which supports neuronal communication and may protect against neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>It increases weight loss by boosting metabolic rate and promoting lipolysis, helping the body burn fat more efficiently.</p>
