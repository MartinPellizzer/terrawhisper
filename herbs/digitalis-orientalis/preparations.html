<h2 id="0">1. Decoctions</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis decoctions is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to its ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rhythm.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation has also been traditionally used to manage hypertension and certain types of respiratory disorders. The most common medicinal uses include treating heart-related ailments, improving circulation, and reducing symptoms of congestive heart failure. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides like digoxin and digitoxin, which act on the heart's sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme.</p>
<p>These compounds help increase the force of myocardial contractions and slow the heart rate, making them valuable in managing cardiac dysfunctions.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Teas</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis teas is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to its potent cardiac glycoside content.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation has also been traditionally used to manage symptoms of hypertension and certain types of respiratory disorders. The most common medicinal uses include supporting heart function, regulating heart rhythm, and reducing fluid retention. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects are primarily cardiac glycosides like digoxin and ouabain, which enhance myocardial contractility and slow heart rate.</p>
<p>These compounds work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels and improved cardiac performance.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Tinctures</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis tinctures is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to its ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate.</p>
<p>These tinctures are also used in traditional medicine to address symptoms of fatigue, respiratory disorders, and skin conditions. The most common medicinal uses include managing heart failure, treating irregular heartbeats, and supporting overall cardiovascular health. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides such as digitoxin and digoxin, which act on the heart's sodium-potassium pump.</p>
<p>These compounds increase the force of heart contractions and slow down the heart rate, making them valuable in therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Capsules</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis capsules is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to their ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate.</p>
<p>The most common medicinal uses of this preparation include managing chronic heart failure, treating certain types of irregular heartbeats, and supporting overall cardiac function. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides like digoxin and ouabain, which act on the heart's sodium-potassium ATPase pump to enhance myocardial contractility. These compounds also have mild effects on the nervous system, contributing to their therapeutic profile.</p>
<p>However, due to their potent nature, these capsules require careful dosing and medical supervision to avoid toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Syrups</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis syrups is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as congestive heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>The preparation is valued for its ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate. It has also been used historically to manage symptoms of certain types of heart disease. The most common medicinal uses include treating heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and other cardiac disorders.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents responsible for its medicinal properties include cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digitoxin, which affect the heart's electrical activity and improve cardiac output.</p>

<h2 id="5">6. Mucillages</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis mucillages is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias due to its cardiotonic properties.</p>
<p>The mucillages, which are viscous and gel-like substances, are extracted from the leaves and roots of the plant. These preparations are also used to manage symptoms of chronic heart disease and to support circulatory health. The most common medicinal uses include treating congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and other cardiac disorders.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digitoxin, which enhance myocardial contractility and regulate heart rhythm.</p>

<h2 id="6">7. Poultices</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis poultices is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure and arrhythmias, due to their ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate.</p>
<p>These poultices are also applied topically to reduce inflammation and promote wound healing in skin conditions. The most common medicinal uses include treating circulatory disorders, edema, and certain types of skin infections. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides like digoxin and digitoxin, which have potent effects on the heart muscle.</p>
<p>Additionally, the plant contains flavonoids and alkaloids that contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>

<h2 id="7">8. Creams</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis creams is commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>These creams are also utilized for their potential anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits. The most common medicinal uses include managing symptoms of heart failure, improving cardiac output, and reducing edema. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides like digoxin and digitoxin, which enhance myocardial contractility.</p>
<p>Additionally, flavonoids and alkaloids contribute to the anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties of the preparation.</p>

<h2 id="8">9. Linctuses</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis linctuses is commonly used to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs and bronchitis due to its expectorant and antitussive properties.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation is traditionally employed to alleviate symptoms of asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections by reducing mucus viscosity and easing breathing. The most common medicinal uses include managing chronic coughs, reducing inflammation in the airways, and improving lung function. The bioactive constituents responsible for these effects include cardiac glycosides like digoxin and digitoxin, which have bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory actions.</p>
<p>These compounds also exhibit mild stimulant properties that enhance respiratory efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="9">10. Lozenges</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis lozenges is commonly used to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs, sore throats, and bronchitis due to their expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These lozenges are also used to alleviate symptoms of asthma and other respiratory disorders by soothing irritated airways. The medicinal effects of Digitalis orientalis lozenges are attributed to their bioactive constituents, including cardiac glycosides like digoxin and lanatoside C, which have stimulant and antispasmodic actions. Additionally, the plant contains flavonoids and alkaloids that contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>However, due to the potential toxicity of its active compounds, Digitalis orientalis should be used with caution and under medical supervision.</p>
