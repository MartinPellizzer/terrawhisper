<h2 id="1">Scientific and Botanical Profile</h2><p>Chinese Prickly Ash, with botanical name Evodia rutaecarpa, is a small evergreen shrub or tree belonging to the Rutaceae family, known for its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p> Native to regions such as China, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Sri Lanka, and the Eastern Himalayas, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.  The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to distinctive, wrinkled fruits known as Evodia Fruit or Rutaecarpa.  Commonly referred to as Buddha's Hand, Bitter Orange, Chuan Liu, Wild Pepper Tree, or Citron, the fruit is widely used in traditional medicine for its analgesic and antispasmodic effects.</p>
<p> Its morphological features, including the fruit's unique shape and aromatic compounds, contribute to its significance in both botanical and pharmacological studies.</p>
<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Chinese Prickly Ash was used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a key herb for treating digestive disorders, liver dysfunction, and pain relief, owing to its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p> Its historical use dates back to ancient texts like the Shennong Bencao Jing, where it was valued for its ability to harmonize the liver and gallbladder, making it a staple in formulations for ailments like hepatitis and gallstones.  In folk traditions, it has been incorporated into rituals to ward off evil spirits and promote good health, particularly during festivals and seasonal transitions.  Today, its extracts are still used in modern herbal remedies for digestive health, with formulations like Wu Zhu Yu and Chuan Lian Zi continuing to be prescribed for conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and menstrual pain.</p>
<p> The plant's enduring presence in both historical and contemporary medicinal practices underscores its deep cultural and therapeutic significance in East Asian traditions.</p>
<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Chinese Prickly Ash contains a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids such as evodiamine and rutaecarpine, which are known for their potent pharmacological effects.</p>
<p> It also contains flavonoids, terpenes, and essential oils that contribute to its medicinal properties and aromatic profile.  Nutritionally, Chinese Prickly Ash is rich in antioxidants, including vitamin C and various polyphenols, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron.  These compounds work synergistically to exert anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and analgesic effects by modulating cellular signaling pathways and reducing oxidative stress in the body.</p>
<p> Its unique chemical composition makes it a valuable component in traditional Chinese medicine for treating ailments such as colds, digestive issues, and pain.</p>
<h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2><p>Evodia rutaecarpa has been widely recognized in traditional Chinese medicine for its potent medicinal properties, particularly its ability to regulate the digestive system and relieve gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>
<p> It is known to support the liver and gallbladder by promoting bile secretion and reducing inflammation, making it beneficial for conditions such as indigestion, gallstones, and liver dysfunction.  Compared to similar herbs like citrus aurantium or cardamom, Evodia rutaecarpa stands out for its stronger potency in addressing stagnation and cold in the liver meridian, offering more targeted therapeutic effects.  Additionally, it has shown potential in reducing oxidative stress and supporting immune function, which contributes to its broader health benefits.</p>
<p> Its unique combination of warming and dispersing properties makes it a valuable herb for balancing internal heat and cold, enhancing its efficacy in treating a range of systemic imbalances.</p>

<p> It can be prepared through methods such as making a tea, decoction, infusion, or applying it topically for different ailments.

<p> Due to its potency, conservative usage is strongly recommended, especially for those new to its application.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Evodia rutaecarpa can be a potent medicinal plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antispasmodic properties, but it requires careful use due to its potential toxicity.</p>
<p> While it may offer therapeutic benefits, it can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, liver damage or even liver failure.  It is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to its potential to cause uterine contractions and harm the fetus or infant.  Individuals with chronic liver disease or those taking medications that affect liver function should avoid evodia rutaecarpa due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p> To ensure safety, it is advisable to consult a qualified healthcare provider before use, follow recommended dosages, and avoid long-term or excessive consumption.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Evodia rutaecarpa grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, in full sun to partial shade, and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging.</p>
<p> It thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers, making it suitable for regions with moderate rainfall.  Regular watering is essential during the growing season, but the soil should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.  For optimal growth, mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds, while pruning can encourage bushier growth and better fruit production.  Harvesting occurs in late summer to early autumn when the fruit turns dark red and is fully mature; the fruits are typically harvested by hand or with pruning shears to avoid damaging the plant.</p>
<p> To preserve potency, the harvested fruits should be dried in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p>
