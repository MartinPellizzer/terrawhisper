<h2 id="0">1. Boosts immune system</h2>
<p>Viscum album boosts immune system because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, flavonoids, and triterpene acids, which have immunomodulatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help stimulate the production of white blood cells and enhance the body's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>This immune-boosting effect can aid in the relief of ailments such as respiratory infections, chronic fatigue, and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>It is also used to support the body's response to viral infections and to strengthen overall immune function.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Boosts antioxidant levels</h2>
<p>Viscum album boosts antioxidant levels because it contains bioactive constituents such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and lectins, which help neutralize free radicals in the body.</p>
<p>These compounds work by enhancing the body's natural defense mechanisms against oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This health benefit is particularly useful in alleviating conditions such as inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of Viscum album may support overall cellular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Reduces inflammation</h2>
<p>Viscum album reduces inflammation because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, viscumin, and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help modulate the immune response and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Conditions such as arthritis, skin inflammation, and inflammatory bowel diseases may be alleviated through the anti-inflammatory effects of Viscum album.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine to support the body's natural healing processes.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Relieves joint pain</h2>
<p>Viscum album relieves joint pain because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, viscumin, and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce swelling and discomfort in the joints by inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
<p>This health benefit is particularly useful for conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory joint disorders.</p>
<p>It may also provide relief for musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain associated with aging.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Reduces stress hormones</h2>
<p>Viscum album reduces stress hormones because it contains bioactive constituents such as flavonoids, triterpenes, and lectins, which have been shown to modulate the body's stress response.</p>
<p>These compounds may help lower cortisol levels, promoting a sense of calm and reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>Conditions such as chronic stress, anxiety disorders, and insomnia can be alleviated with the stress-reducing effects of Viscum album.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine to support emotional well-being and balance the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="5">6. Reduces oxidative stress</h2>
<p>Viscum album reduces oxidative stress because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, triterpenes, and flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties that neutralize free radicals in the body.</p>
<p>These compounds help protect cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is linked to various ailments, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disorders, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.</p>
<p>By mitigating oxidative stress, Viscum album may support overall cellular health and potentially alleviate symptoms associated with these conditions.</p>

<h2 id="6">7. Fights cancer cells</h2>
<p>Viscum album fights cancer cells because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, viscumin, and flavonoids, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancerous cells.</p>
<p>These compounds may induce apoptosis, block angiogenesis, and reduce metastasis in various types of cancer.</p>
<p>This health benefit has been associated with the relief of ailments such as breast cancer, leukemia, and colon cancer.</p>
<p>Research suggests that Viscum album may support oncological treatments and improve patient outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="7">8. Treats arthritis</h2>
<p>Viscum album treats arthritis because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, triterpenes, and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce joint inflammation and pain associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to modulate the immune system also aids in alleviating symptoms of autoimmune-related joint disorders.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine to relieve chronic joint pain and improve mobility in arthritis patients.</p>

<h2 id="8">9. Fights viral infections</h2>
<p>Viscum album fights viral infections because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, which have antiviral properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help inhibit viral replication and enhance immune response.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used to relieve symptoms of common colds, influenza, and other respiratory viral infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may support the body's defense against herpes simplex and HIV-related conditions.</p>

<h2 id="9">10. Reduces tumor growth</h2>
<p>Viscum album reduces tumor growth because it contains bioactive constituents such as lectins, viscumin, and terpenoids, which have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.</p>
<p>These compounds may interfere with tumor angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in malignant cells.</p>
