<h2 id="6">7. Reduces menstrual pain</h2>
<p>Menstrual pain, also known as dysmenorrhea, is a common condition characterized by cramping and discomfort in the lower abdomen during menstruation.</p>
<p>This painful experience is often caused by the contraction of the uterine muscles as the uterus sheds its lining, releasing prostaglandins that can lead to inflammation and spasms.</p>
<p>It commonly affects women of reproductive age, particularly those with heavy or irregular periods.</p>
<p>Rosa gallica, a traditional medicinal plant, has been studied for its potential to alleviate these symptoms by reducing inflammation and muscle spasms.</p>

<h2 id="8">9. Treats urinary tract</h2>
<p>Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that affects the urinary system, including the bladder, urethra, and kidneys.</p>
<p>Often referred to as a urinary tract infection, this condition can cause discomfort, pain, and frequent urination.</p>
<p>It is typically caused by the growth of bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli, which enters the urinary tract through the urethra.</p>
<p>Women are more prone to UTIs due to their shorter urethra, and individuals with weakened immune systems or certain medical conditions may also be at higher risk.</p>
<p>Rosa gallica, also known as the Gallic Rose, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial properties, which may help in treating urinary tract infections by inhibiting bacterial growth and supporting urinary health.</p>
