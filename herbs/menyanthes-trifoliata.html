<p> It prefers cool, temperate climates and requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season, though it should not be waterlogged.  To ensure healthy growth, regular watering is necessary, and the area should be free from weeds to reduce competition for nutrients.  For optimal care, divide the plant every few years to prevent overcrowding and ensure good air circulation, which helps prevent disease.  Harvesting should occur in late summer to early autumn when the leaves are fully developed and the plant is at its peak potency, using clean scissors to cut the foliage just above the ground.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the leaves should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good airflow to preserve their medicinal properties, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to maintain potency over time.</p>
