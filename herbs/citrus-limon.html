<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of citrus limon</h2>
<p>Citrus limon limonene is a major terpene found in the essential oils of the lemon plant, known for its potent antioxidant properties and ability to support the body's natural detoxification processes by stimulating the liver's metabolic functions.</p>
<p>Citrus limon vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system, promotes collagen synthesis, and helps protect cells from oxidative stress caused by free radicals.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of citrus limon</h2>
<p>Citrus limon teas are widely consumed for their refreshing taste and therapeutic properties, often made by steeping the dried peel or whole fruits in hot water, which releases compounds like limonene and flavonoids that aid digestion and reduce stress.</p>
<p>Citrus limon decoctions, typically prepared by boiling the peel or citrus fruits for an extended period, are valued for their concentrated flavor and are commonly used in traditional medicine to support liver function and detoxification.</p>
<p>Citrus limon tinctures, created by soaking the peel in alcohol, are popular for their potent antioxidant properties and are used to treat respiratory issues and skin conditions due to their high concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>Citrus limon essential oils, extracted through cold pressing, are extensively used in aromatherapy and natural remedies for their uplifting scent and antibacterial properties, making them a key ingredient in diffusers, topical applications, and personal care products.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of citrus limon</h2>
<p>Citrus limon may cause allergic reactions due to the presence of allergenic proteins and compounds such as limonene, which can trigger immune responses in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>It can cause skin irritation because of its high concentration of citric acid and essential oils, which may irritate the skin upon direct contact.</p>
