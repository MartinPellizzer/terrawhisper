<p>Conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke risk are related to this benefit and can be mitigated through regular consumption of Allium chinense.</p>
<p>Its natural properties make it a valuable addition to a heart-healthy diet.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Boosts immune system</h2>
<p>Allium chinense boosts immune system because it contains bioactive constituents such as allicin, quercetin, and sulfur compounds, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help stimulate the production of immune cells and enhance the body's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>This health benefit can help relieve ailments such as respiratory infections, common colds, and even support recovery from viral infections.</p>
<p>It is also beneficial for individuals with weakened immune systems or those prone to frequent illnesses.</p>

<h2 id="5">6. Lowers cholesterol levels</h2>
<p>Allium chinense lowers cholesterol levels because it contains bioactive constituents such as sulfur compounds, flavonoids, and alkaloids, which help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<p>These compounds work by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and promoting its excretion.</p>
<p>This health benefit can alleviate conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of Allium chinense may also support overall heart health and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.</p>

<h2 id="6">7. Reduces muscle pain</h2>
<p>Allium chinense reduces muscle pain because it contains bioactive constituents such as allicin, quercetin, and sulfur compounds, which have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
