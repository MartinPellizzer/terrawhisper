<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Quillaja saponaria prevents infection due to its antimicrobial properties, which inhibit the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi by disrupting their cell membranes and interfering with their replication processes.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation by containing compounds that inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes like cyclooxygenase, thereby decreasing swelling and redness in affected tissues. It heals wounds by promoting cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, as its saponins stimulate collagen synthesis and enhance the activity of fibroblasts involved in wound repair. It prevents diarrhea by regulating intestinal motility and reducing the secretion of fluids into the gut, which helps maintain normal bowel function and hydration.</p>
<p>It reduces pain by interacting with pain receptors and modulating inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating discomfort associated with various conditions.</p>
