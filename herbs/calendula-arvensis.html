To ensure healthy growth, regular weeding and occasional fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer can help promote vigorous plant development. Harvesting should occur when the flowers are fully open and the petals are vibrant, typically in late summer to early autumn, using sharp scissors to cut the flower heads without damaging the stems.</p><p>For preservation, the harvested flowers should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain potency and extend shelf life.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Calendula arvensis, also known as common calendula, is a medicinal plant widely used for its anti-inflammatory and skin-healing properties.</p><p>It is generally safe to grow at home, as it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an easy addition to gardens or containers. The effects of calendula arvensis can typically be noticed within a few weeks of regular use, though results may vary depending on the individual and the condition being treated. It can be combined with other herbs such as chamomile or lavender to enhance its therapeutic benefits, but it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before creating herbal combinations.</p><p>For long-term safety, it is recommended to use calendula arvensis under medical supervision, as prolonged use may lead to side effects, and the best way to consume it is through topical applications or by making teas from its dried flowers.</p>
