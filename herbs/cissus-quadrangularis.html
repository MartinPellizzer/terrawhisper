There is limited research on its interactions with medications, but it may interfere with anticoagulants or diabetes medications, so caution is advised. Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid its use due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p><p>To ensure safe use, it is recommended to start with low doses, monitor for adverse reactions, and consult a healthcare professional, especially if taking other medications or supplements.</p><h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Cissus quadrangularis grows best in well-draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring regular watering to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions.</p><p>It benefits from occasional fertilization during the growing season to promote healthy growth and medicinal compound production. Regular pruning and weed control are essential for maintaining plant health and encouraging new growth, while monitoring for pests like aphids and spider mites ensures optimal care. Harvesting is best done in the early morning or late afternoon when the plant's active compounds are most concentrated, using clean, sharp tools to cut the stems just above a node to encourage regrowth.</p><p>After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area to preserve potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain its medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Cissus quadrangularis, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a medicinal plant widely used for its potential health benefits.</p><p>It can be grown at home in warm climates, requiring well-draining soil and plenty of sunlight, making it a suitable choice for indoor or outdoor cultivation.
