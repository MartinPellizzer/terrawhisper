Its active compounds, such as alkaloids like protopine and allocryptine, contribute to its medicinal effects by influencing the central nervous system. In modern herbal medicine, it is sometimes used as a natural alternative to pharmaceutical sedatives, though it should be used with caution due to its potential for dependency.</p><p>Despite its benefits, the California Poppy is also considered a noxious weed in some areas, highlighting the dual nature of its impact on ecosystems and human health.</p>
