The resin is often used to treat gastrointestinal issues such as bloating, flatulence, and indigestion due to its ability to stimulate digestive enzymes. Additionally, it is believed to have antimicrobial and analgesic effects, making it a popular ingredient in traditional herbal remedies.</p><p>Asafoetida is also used in some cultures as a spice, although its strong odor makes it more commonly used in medicinal formulations than in cooking.</p>
