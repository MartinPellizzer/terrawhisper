Raffinose is a type of oligosaccharide that can aid in digestive health by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Lecithin serves as an emulsifier and is essential for maintaining the structure of cell membranes, while isoflavones, a group of phytoestrogens, have been studied for their potential roles in hormone regulation, cardiovascular health, and bone density maintenance.</p>
<p>These compounds work synergistically to provide a range of health benefits, making Glycine max a valuable herb in traditional and modern medicine.</p>
