<p> To ensure safe use, it is recommended to follow recommended dosages, consult a healthcare professional, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Bixa orellana grows best in warm, tropical climates with well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter and has a pH between 5.</p>
<p>5 and 7. 5.  It requires full sun to partial shade and consistent moisture, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.  Regular watering during the growing season and mulching to retain soil moisture are essential for healthy plant development.  The best time to harvest the seeds is when the capsules turn from green to yellow or orange, typically 6 to 8 months after planting, using a gentle twisting motion to avoid damaging the plant.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the seeds should be dried in a cool, shaded area to preserve their potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p>
