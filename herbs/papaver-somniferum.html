<h2 id="4">Side Effects of papaver somniferum</h2>
<p>Papaver somniferum causes respiratory depression because the opioid compounds it contains, such as morphine and codeine, act on the brain's respiratory centers, slowing down the rate and depth of breathing.</p>
<p>Papaver somniferum induces drowsiness because these opioids bind to mu-opioid receptors in the brain, which are involved in regulating wakefulness and sleep.</p>
<p>Papaver somniferum induces dry mouth because opioids reduce saliva production by acting on the salivary glands and central nervous system.</p>
<p>Papaver somniferum induces dependency because repeated use leads to changes in the brain's reward system, making it difficult for users to stop using the herb without experiencing withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>The 11 most common side effects of Papaver somniferum are shown in the image below.</p>
<img src="/images/herbs/papaver-somniferum-side-effects.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
