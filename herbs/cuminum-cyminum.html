It reduces inflammation by containing compounds like thymol and limonene, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body. It treats diarrhea by regulating gut motility and reducing the secretion of fluids into the intestines, thus restoring normal bowel function.</p>
