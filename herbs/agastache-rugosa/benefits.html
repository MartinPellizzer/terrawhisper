The plant's essential oils also contribute to its ability to regulate gut motility and improve digestion. Alkaloids in Agastache rugosa may enhance the secretion of digestive enzymes, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Flavonoids support overall gut health by reducing oxidative stress and promoting a balanced microbiome.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Planta medica", Agastache rugosa has been found to treat digestive issues, specifically reducing gastric damages by more than 40% and inflammation by about 30% in an animal model with gastritis.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Heals wounds faster</h2>
<p>Wound healing.</p>
<p>Wound recovery.</p>
<p>Tissue repair.</p>
<p>Skin injury restoration.</p>
<p>The process of wound healing involves the body's natural mechanisms to repair damaged tissues, often slowed by factors like infection, poor circulation, or inflammation.</p>
