<h2 id="0">1. Reduce inflammation</h2>
<p>Inflammation is a defensive response of the body to injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, and pain.</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation refers to a prolonged and often low-level inflammatory response that can damage tissues over time.</p>
<p>It is commonly caused by persistent exposure to irritants, autoimmune reactions, or unresolved infections.</p>
<p>People with conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome are more likely to experience chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>The hedera helix plant has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation by containing compounds that may inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
