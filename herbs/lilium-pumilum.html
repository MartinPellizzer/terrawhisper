<p> It thrives in cool climates with moderate temperatures, and regular watering during the growing season ensures healthy growth and bulb development.  To maintain vigor, it benefits from mulching to retain soil moisture and protect roots from extreme temperatures, along with annual fertilization with a balanced organic fertilizer in early spring.  Harvesting occurs in late summer to early autumn when the stems turn yellow and the bulbs are fully mature, using a garden fork to carefully lift the bulbs to avoid damage.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the harvested bulbs should be dried in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight, then stored in a cool, dry place in breathable containers to prevent moisture buildup and prolong shelf life.</p>
