                <h1>Clusia Engleriana</h1><p>Clusia engleriana, commonly known as the "Poinciana tree" or "Spoonwood," has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its diverse therapeutic properties.</p><p>The plant contains bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, which contribute to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. In traditional remedies, extracts from its leaves and bark have been applied to treat skin infections, wounds, and inflammatory conditions. It is also used in some regions to manage diabetes and as a diuretic due to its potential hypoglycemic properties.</p><p>However, further scientific research is needed to fully validate its medicinal potential and ensure its safe use in modern pharmacology.</p>
