<p>In addition to the fruit, other medicinal parts of Prunus avium, such as the seed and flower, have been utilized in herbal remedies. The seed contains amygdalin, which has been studied for its potential anti-cancer properties, although its use is controversial due to potential toxicity. The flowers, on the other hand, are often used in teas to promote relaxation and reduce stress, owing to their mild sedative effects.</p>
<p>Overall, different parts of Prunus avium offer a range of health benefits, making it a valuable plant in both traditional and modern medicinal practices.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Prunus avium teas are a popular preparation method, often made by steeping dried cherry leaves or fruits in hot water to extract their beneficial compounds, such as antioxidants and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These teas are valued for their calming effects and are commonly used to support digestion and reduce inflammation. Decoctions, which involve boiling the plant material for a longer period, are used for tougher parts like bark or roots, though less common with Prunus avium.</p>
<p>Tinctures, made by soaking the herb in alcohol, offer a concentrated form of the plant’s active ingredients and are often used for their potential antispasmodic and sedative properties. Additionally, Prunus avium can be found in creams and oils, which are applied topically to soothe skin irritations or promote healing.
