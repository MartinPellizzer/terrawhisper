<h2 id="3">4. Has anti-inflammatory effects</h2>
<p>Chronic inflammation is a persistent, low-level inflammatory response that can lead to various diseases.</p>
<p>Chronic inflammation refers to prolonged activation of the immune system, which can damage healthy tissues over time.</p>
<p>It is often caused by long-term exposure to irritants, infections, or genetic factors.</p>
<p>This condition is commonly experienced by individuals with autoimmune disorders, obesity, or those suffering from metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>The cicer arietinum plant, also known as chickpeas, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce the risk and severity of chronic inflammation.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/cicer-arietinum-benefits-has-anti-inflammatory-effects.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with has anti-inflammatory effects?</h2>
<p>Cicer arietinum has anti-inflammatory effects because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
