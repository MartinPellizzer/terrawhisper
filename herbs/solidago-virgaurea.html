<p> It thrives in temperate climates and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established.  To ensure optimal growth, it should be planted in early spring or fall, with spacing to allow for air circulation and prevent disease.  Regular weeding and pruning of dead foliage in late winter encourage vigorous growth and prevent overcrowding.  For harvesting, the best time is during the late summer to early autumn when the flower heads are fully developed and the plant is at its peak potency.  The flowers should be cut with clean shears or scissors, ensuring minimal damage to the plant.  After harvesting, the flowers should be spread out in a single layer in a cool, dry place to dry completely, preserving their medicinal properties.</p>
<p> Once fully dried, they should be stored in airtight glass containers in a cool, dark place to maintain potency and prevent moisture damage.</p>
