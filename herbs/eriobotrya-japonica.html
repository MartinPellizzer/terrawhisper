<p> It thrives in temperate climates and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.  Pruning is essential for maintaining shape and promoting fruit production, while mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  The fruit is typically harvested in late summer to early autumn when it turns a deep red or orange, using pruning shears to cut the fruit from the branch without damaging the tree.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the fruit should be dried in a cool, well-ventilated area or in a dehydrator, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to preserve its medicinal properties.</p>
