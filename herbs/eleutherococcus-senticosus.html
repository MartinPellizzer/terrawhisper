<h2 id="4">Side Effects of eleutherococcus senticosus</h2>
<p>Eleutherococcus senticosus leads to restlessness, a common side effect reported in individuals using the herb, often due to its stimulating properties that can overexcite the nervous system.</p>
<p>This restlessness may be accompanied by anxiety, as the herb can heighten feelings of unease and tension, particularly in sensitive individuals. Insomnia is another notable side effect, as the herb's ability to increase alertness and disrupt sleep patterns can lead to difficulty falling or staying asleep. Additionally, eleutherococcus senticosus may induce sweating, a response linked to its thermogenic effects, which can be more pronounced in higher doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause fatigue, paradoxically, as the herb's stimulating nature may lead to a crash in energy levels after an initial surge. Furthermore, it has been reported to increase heart rate, potentially causing palpitations or a sense of urgency. Nausea may occur in some users, especially when the herb is taken on an empty stomach or in excessive amounts.</p>
<p>These side effects highlight the importance of proper dosage and individual sensitivity when using eleutherococcus senticosus.</p>
