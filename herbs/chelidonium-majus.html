<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus alkaloids, such as chelidonine, sanguinarine, and berberine, are among the most significant medicinal constituents of the plant, known for their potent pharmacological effects.</p>
<p>These alkaloids exhibit strong analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, making them valuable in traditional and modern medicine. Chelidonine, in particular, has been studied for its ability to act as a central nervous system depressant and for its potential in pain management. Sanguinarine is noted for its ability to inhibit microbial growth and has been used in the treatment of infections.</p>
<p>Berberine, although more commonly associated with other plants like Hydrastis canadensis, is also present in Chelidonium majus and contributes to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. These alkaloids, along with other compounds such as sterols, flavonoids, and glycosides, work synergistically to enhance the therapeutic potential of Chelidonium majus. However, due to their toxic nature, the use of this herb requires careful regulation and professional guidance to avoid adverse effects.</p>
<p>Overall, the alkaloids of Chelidonium majus play a crucial role in its medicinal profile, offering both therapeutic benefits and potential risks.</p>

<li><strong>Fatty Acids</strong>: Fatty acids are essential components of cell membranes and play a key role in energy storage, signaling, and the regulation of various physiological processes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus leaf contains various bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, which contribute to its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, making them useful in treating conditions like rheumatism and skin irritations. However, due to the presence of toxic alkaloids such as chelidonine and sanguinarine, the leaves must be used with caution and under professional supervision.</p>
<p>In some traditional herbal practices, the leaves are also employed to stimulate digestion and treat respiratory ailments. While the leaves are a primary source of medicinal compounds, the root and fruit of Chelidonium majus also contain valuable components. The root is known for its potential antispasmodic and antidiarrheal properties, while the fruit contains alkaloids that may have applications in treating parasitic infections.</p>
<p>Overall, all parts of Chelidonium majus have been historically valued in herbal medicine, though their use requires careful handling due to the plant's inherent toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus tinctures are commonly used in herbal medicine for their purported ability to support liver function and detoxification processes.</p>
<p>These tinctures are typically made by soaking the dried plant material in alcohol, which helps extract the active compounds such as alkaloids like chelidonine and sanguinarine. They are often recommended for digestive support and as a remedy for skin conditions, though they should be used with caution due to their potential toxicity.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus decoctions involve boiling the herb in water to create a concentrated herbal tea, which is believed to aid in clearing liver congestion and promoting overall metabolic health. Capsules provide a more convenient and standardized form of the herb, allowing for consistent dosing and easier integration into daily routines. In addition to these forms, chelidonium majus oils are sometimes used topically for their anti-inflammatory properties, though they should be diluted before application to avoid skin irritation.</p>
<p>Each preparation method offers unique benefits and considerations, making it essential to consult a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider before use.</p>
