<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of chelidonium majus</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus alkaloids, such as chelidonine, sanguinarine, and allocryptine, are potent compounds with strong analgesic, antitussive, and antimicrobial properties, and they are primarily responsible for the plant's medicinal effects, though they also contribute to its toxicity.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus sterols, including Î²-sitosterol and stigmasterol, exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, and they may help in reducing cholesterol levels and supporting cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties, which contribute to the plant's overall therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus glycosides, including sanguinoflavone and chelidonic acid, are believed to have hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, and they may aid in detoxification processes within the body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of chelidonium majus</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus leaf contains alkaloids such as chelidonine and sanguinarine, which have been traditionally used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The leaf can be used to make herbal teas or tinctures, often employed to alleviate pain and treat skin conditions.</p>
<p>The root of Chelidonium majus contains similar alkaloids and is typically prepared as a tincture or decoction to support digestive health and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>The fruit, which contains the highest concentration of alkaloids, is usually processed into a tincture or powder for its potent therapeutic effects.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of chelidonium majus</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus tinctures are commonly prepared by soaking the plant's roots and leaves in alcohol, resulting in a concentrated herbal preparation that is often used for its purported detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus decoctions involve boiling the dried herb in water to extract its active compounds, making it a popular choice for digestive support and skin conditions due to its bitter and stimulating effects.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus capsules offer a convenient and standardized form of the herb, encapsulating dried plant material for easy consumption, often used for its potential to support liver function and metabolic processes.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus oils, typically extracted through cold pressing or infusion, are valued for their aromatic and topical applications, often used in massage or as a natural remedy for muscle pain and skin ailments.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of chelidonium majus</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus causes skin irritation due to the presence of alkaloids such as berberine and chelidonine, which can provoke an inflammatory response in the skin upon contact.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus induces vomiting because its alkaloidal content stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, leading to nausea and subsequent vomiting.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus leads to nausea as the same alkaloids can irritate the gastrointestinal tract and affect the central nervous system's vomiting reflex.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus may cause liver damage because some of its compounds are metabolized by the liver, potentially leading to toxicity and impaired liver function over time.</p>
