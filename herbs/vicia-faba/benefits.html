<h2 id="1">2. Kill bacteria</h2>
<p>Vicia faba kill bacteria because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids, saponins, and flavonoids, which exhibit antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>These compounds inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria by disrupting their cell membranes or interfering with their metabolic processes.</p>
<p>This health benefit can help alleviate ailments such as gastrointestinal infections and skin conditions caused by bacterial overgrowth.</p>
<p>It also supports immune function and may reduce the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Lower triglycerides</h2>
<p>Vicia faba lower triglycerides because it contains bioactive constituents such as rutin, saponins, and polyphenols, which help reduce lipid accumulation in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>These compounds work by improving insulin sensitivity and inhibiting the synthesis of triglycerides in the liver.</p>
<p>Conditions such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are relieved or mitigated through the triglyceride-lowering effects of this plant.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of Vicia faba can support overall cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of related ailments.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Lower blood sugar</h2>
<p>Vicia faba lower blood sugar because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids, saponins, and flavonoids, which help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce glucose absorption.</p>
<p>These compounds support metabolic regulation and may enhance the body's ability to manage blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>Conditions such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome can be alleviated with the blood sugar-lowering effects of this plant.</p>
