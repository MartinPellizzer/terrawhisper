<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Orthosiphon Aristata contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and terpenes, which contribute to its medicinal properties.</p>
<p> The plant is also rich in nutrients such as vitamins C and B-complex, along with minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, making it a valuable source of essential micronutrients.

The recommended dosage for adults is typically 1 to 2 grams of dried leaves per cup of water, taken up to three times daily, while for children, it should only be used under medical supervision.</p>
<p> Due to the lack of extensive clinical studies, usage should be conservative, with short-term application preferred unless otherwise advised by a healthcare professional.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Orthosiphon aristata can be used as a medicinal plant for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties, but it is important to consider its safety profile.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in moderation, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, and allergic reactions in some individuals.  It may interact with medications like diuretics, antihypertensives, and diabetes drugs, potentially increasing their effects or causing adverse outcomes.  Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid its use due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic conditions like kidney disease should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, it is recommended to follow recommended dosages, consult with a healthcare professional, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Orthosiphon aristata grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soil with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, in a warm and sunny location with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.  It requires consistent moisture during the growing season but should not be overwatered, as it is susceptible to root rot.  Regular pruning and weeding help maintain plant health and encourage new growth, while mulching can retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  Harvesting is best done in the early morning or late afternoon, when the plant's essential oils are most concentrated, by cutting the leaves and stems just above the base using clean, sharp shears.</p>
<p> To preserve its potency, the harvested material should be thoroughly dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area before being stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place, or refrigerated to extend shelf life.</p>
