The active compounds, such as anthraquinones, stimulate bowel movements by increasing intestinal motility and softening stool. However, prolonged use can lead to dependency and potential toxicity, so it is typically recommended for short-term use under medical supervision.</p><p>Despite its effectiveness, Cascara Sagrada is not suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain gastrointestinal conditions or during pregnancy.</p>
