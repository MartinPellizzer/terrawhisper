While generally considered safe when used in moderate amounts, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, skin irritation, or allergic reactions in some individuals. There is limited research on its interactions with other drugs or herbs, so caution is advised when combining it with medications like anticoagulants or anti-inflammatory drugs. Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid geranium nepalense due to insufficient evidence on its safety during these periods, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use. To ensure safe use, it is recommended to use geranium nepalense under professional guidance, start with small doses, and discontinue use if adverse effects occur.<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2>Geranium nepalense grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, in full sun to partial shade, and with consistent moisture during the growing season.

To ensure healthy growth, it benefits from occasional fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring. The plant is typically harvested during the late summer to early autumn when the leaves and flowers are most potent, using clean shears to cut the stems just above the base. After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its medicinal potency.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Geranium nepalense is a medicinal plant known for its potential health benefits, often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
