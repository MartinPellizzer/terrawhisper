<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Solanum tuberosum root, commonly known as the potato, is primarily valued for its tuberous underground stems rather than its root system.</p>
<p>While the root itself is not typically harvested or used medicinally, the tubers contain a variety of bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential health benefits. These compounds include alkaloids, glycoalkaloids, and various phytochemicals that may exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, potato extracts have been used to treat ailments such as skin infections, digestive issues, and even as a remedy for fever. However, it is important to note that the use of Solanum tuberosum in medicinal applications is often limited to its tuberous parts, and the root is not a primary focus in either traditional or modern pharmacological research.</p>
<p>The medicinal potential of the plant is more widely recognized in its leaves and fruits, which contain different compounds with their own therapeutic uses.</p>
