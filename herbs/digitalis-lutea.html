<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Digitalis lutea leaf has been historically utilized in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin and digitoxin, which are known for their ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rhythm. These compounds are primarily responsible for the herb's use in treating heart conditions like congestive heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>However, the leaves are typically less potent than the flowers in terms of the concentration of these active compounds. The flowers of Digitalis lutea are also valued for their medicinal properties, particularly for their cardiac glycoside content, which makes them more effective in certain therapeutic applications. While both parts of the plant have medicinal significance, the flowers are often preferred for their higher concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the use of Digitalis lutea requires caution due to its toxicity, and it should only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.</p>
