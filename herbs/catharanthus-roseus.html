<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Catharanthus roseus fights cancer cells due to its alkaloids, such as vincristine and vinblastine, which inhibit microtubule formation, preventing cancer cell division and promoting apoptosis.</p>
<p>It cures malaria quickly because its alkaloids interfere with the Plasmodium parasite's ability to replicate within red blood cells, reducing the parasite load rapidly. It has antimicrobial properties because the plant contains compounds that disrupt bacterial cell membranes and inhibit fungal enzyme activity, effectively combating a wide range of pathogens. It produces antidepressant effects by increasing the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which helps regulate mood and reduce symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>It treats fungal infections due to its ability to inhibit the growth of fungi by disrupting their cell wall synthesis and interfering with their metabolic processes.</p>
