The resin, often referred to as "gum guaiac," was historically used to treat respiratory ailments, such as coughs and bronchitis, due to its expectorant properties. Today, it is also used in alternative medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p><p>However, its use is limited due to the tree's endangered status and the lack of robust scientific evidence supporting many of its traditional applications.</p>
