<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Trichosanthes kirilowii can be used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties, but it should be approached with caution due to its potential toxicity.</p>

<p> To ensure safe use, always consult a qualified healthcare provider before incorporating trichosanthes kirilowii into a treatment regimen, and follow recommended dosages to minimize risks.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Trichosanthes kirilowii grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, in a sunny location that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.  It requires consistent moisture, especially during the growing season, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.  Regular watering and mulching help retain soil moisture and suppress weeds, while periodic pruning of lower leaves improves air circulation and reduces disease risk.  The plant is typically harvested when the fruit turns yellow and begins to split open, usually 80 to 120 days after planting, using a sharp knife to cut the fruit from the vine without damaging the stem.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the harvested fruit should be thoroughly dried in a cool, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain its medicinal properties.</p>
