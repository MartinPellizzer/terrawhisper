<p>It relieves joint discomfort by modulating the activity of enzymes like cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), which are involved in the inflammatory response, thereby decreasing pain and swelling in the joints. It boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, and by increasing the activity of antioxidants that protect against cellular damage. It reduces arthritis symptoms by suppressing the inflammatory pathways associated with autoimmune responses, thus alleviating joint stiffness, swelling, and pain.</p>
<p>It treats rheumatism pain through its ability to inhibit inflammatory mediators and support cartilage health, providing relief from chronic pain and improving joint mobility.</p>
