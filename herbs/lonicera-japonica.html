In Chinese medicine, lonicera japonica is frequently used to clear heat and detoxify the body, making it a popular ingredient in formulations for treating infections and inflammation. Modern research has also explored its potential as a source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.</p><p>Due to its versatility and therapeutic properties, lonicera japonica continues to be an important component in both traditional and contemporary herbal remedies.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Lonicera japonica can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p><p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the honeysuckle family, leading to skin rashes or respiratory issues. Long-term use of lonicera japonica has been associated with liver toxicity in some cases, although more research is needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, potentially reducing their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.</p><p>Due to these potential risks, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using lonicera japonica as a supplement or in traditional remedies.</p>
