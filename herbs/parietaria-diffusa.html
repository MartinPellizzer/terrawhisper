The leaves and flowers of Parietaria diffusa are often harvested and dried for use in tinctures and teas to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis and skin irritations. However, due to its potential toxicity, especially when consumed in large quantities, its use in medicinal applications is often limited and requires careful preparation.</p><p>Despite these risks, some studies suggest it may have applications in treating respiratory and skin conditions, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.</p>
