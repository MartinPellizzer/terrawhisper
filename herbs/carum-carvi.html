<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Carum carvi leaf is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and slightly spicy flavor, though it is less commonly utilized compared to other parts of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves contain essential oils, such as carvone and limonene, which contribute to its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and carminative effects.

The leaves, though less prominent, still play a role in supporting overall wellness when incorporated into herbal formulations. Their use is often complemented by other parts of the plant to enhance therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p>Overall, while the leaf contributes to the plant's medicinal profile, it is the fruit and seeds that are most valued in traditional and modern herbal practices.</p>

In some individuals, Carum carvi may also cause skin irritation, especially if applied topically, due to its potential allergenic properties.</p>
