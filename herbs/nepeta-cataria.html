<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Nepeta cataria eases anxiety symptoms due to its calming properties, which are largely attributed to the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that interacts with the central nervous system to promote relaxation and reduce feelings of stress.</p>
<p>It relieves stress tension by acting as a mild sedative, helping to lower cortisol levels and enhance mood through its aromatic compounds that stimulate the release of serotonin and GABA in the brain. It reduces inflammation swelling by containing anti-inflammatory compounds like flavonoids and polyphenols, which inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce oxidative stress in the body. It fights bacterial growth due to its essential oils, which have antimicrobial properties that disrupt bacterial cell membranes and inhibit the growth of various pathogens.</p>
<p>It aids allergy relief by acting as a natural antihistamine, helping to reduce histamine release and alleviate symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and nasal congestion.</p>
