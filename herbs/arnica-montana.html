<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2><p>Arnica montana has several health benefits, such as reducing inflammation and pain in muscles and joints.</p><p>It is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of arthritis, sprains, and bruises due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The herb contains compounds like helenalin and other sesquiterpene lactones that contribute to its therapeutic effects.

Arnica montana tea, for instance, is often consumed to alleviate symptoms of colds and digestive issues, though it is generally recommended for external use due to its potent nature. Tinctures and salves are widely applied topically to reduce pain and swelling in muscles and joints.</p><p>However, it is important to note that arnica montana should be used with caution, as it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Arnica montana can have some side effects, such as skin irritation or allergic reactions when applied topically.</p><p>Ingesting arnica montana can lead to serious complications, including gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and vomiting. It may also cause heart arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest in severe cases.
