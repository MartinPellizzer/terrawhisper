<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2><p>Andrographis paniculata has several health benefits, such as boosting the immune system and reducing the severity of cold and flu symptoms.</p><p>It contains bioactive compounds like andrographolide, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Studies suggest that it may help alleviate symptoms of respiratory infections and support overall immune function. Additionally, it has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its potential to reduce fever and improve digestion.</p><p>Its adaptogenic qualities may also help the body manage stress and enhance vitality.</p><h2 id="2">Constituents</h2><p>Andrographis paniculata has several bioactive constituents, such as andrographolide, neoandrographolide, and dehydroandrographolide, which are known for their potent pharmacological properties.</p><p>These compounds exhibit strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, making them valuable in the treatment of various diseases. Andrographolide, in particular, is the most studied active component and is responsible for many of the plant's therapeutic benefits. It has been shown to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and cytokines.</p><p>Due to these properties, andrographis paniculata is widely used in traditional medicine and has gained attention in modern pharmacology for its potential in managing infections and inflammatory conditions.</p><h2 id="3">Preparations</h2><p>Andrographis paniculata has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and extracts, that are commonly used in traditional and complementary medicine.</p><p>Its leaves are often dried and brewed into a bitter-tasting tea, which is believed to support immune function and reduce inflammation. Tinctures made from the plant are typically alcohol-based and used for their antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Extracts, particularly standardized ones containing andrographolide, are available in capsule or tablet form for more consistent dosing.</p><p>These preparations are widely used in both Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine to address respiratory infections, fever, and digestive issues.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Andrographis paniculata can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when taken in high doses.</p><p>It may also cause skin reactions like rashes or itching in some individuals. In rare cases, it has been associated with allergic reactions, which can range from mild to severe. Long-term use might lead to liver toxicity, though this is uncommon and more research is needed to confirm the extent of this risk.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, particularly for those with pre-existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p>
