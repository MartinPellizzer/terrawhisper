                <h1>Ammi Visnaga</h1><p>Ammi visnaga, also known as cow parsley or wild carrot, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, particularly in the treatment of urinary tract infections and kidney stones.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as apiol and limonene, which are believed to have diuretic and antispasmodic effects, aiding in the relief of bladder discomfort and promoting urine flow. In herbal medicine, Ammi visnaga is often prepared as a tincture or infusion to support kidney function and reduce inflammation in the urinary system. However, it should be used with caution, as it can be toxic in high doses and may cause gastrointestinal upset or allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Ammi visnaga for medicinal purposes.</p>
