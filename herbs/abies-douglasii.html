                <h1>Abies Douglasii</h1><p>Abies douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties due to its rich content of essential oils, resins, and other bioactive compounds.</p><p>The tree's needles and resin have been employed in herbal medicine to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs, bronchitis, and asthma, owing to their expectorant and anti-inflammatory effects. The essential oil extracted from the bark and needles is known to have antimicrobial properties, making it useful in treating skin infections and wounds. In traditional medicine, it has also been used to alleviate pain and inflammation, often in the form of poultices or infusions.</p><p>While more research is needed, preliminary studies suggest that compounds in Abies douglasii may have potential in supporting immune function and respiratory health.</p>
