<p> Native to the Middle East, Southwest Asia, Western Asia, the Near East, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Iraq, it has been a staple food for thousands of years.  Morphologically, the chickpea plant is an annual herb with compound leaves, upright stems, and yellow flowers that give way to pods containing 2-4 kidney-shaped seeds.  Commonly referred to as chickpea, garbanzo bean, ceci, Egyptian bean, Egyptian pea, gram, cici, and cicer, it is a versatile legume valued for its protein-rich seeds.</p>
<p> Its adaptability to various climates and soils has contributed to its global cultivation and use in diverse cuisines.</p>

<p> In traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Unani, chickpeas have been utilized for their purported health benefits, including improving digestion and treating skin conditions.  The plant holds cultural significance in various rituals, such as the preparation of special dishes during festivals like Navratri in India or the Jewish Passover Seder, where it symbolizes sustenance and resilience.

<p> While generally safe when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, it may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as bloating, gas, and constipation in some individuals.  Individuals with legume allergies should avoid it, as it may trigger allergic reactions ranging from mild skin irritation to severe anaphylaxis.  It may interact with certain medications, including those for diabetes and hypertension, so it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use.  During pregnancy and breastfeeding, cicer arietinum should be consumed in limited amounts or avoided altogether due to insufficient research on its effects on fetal and infant development.</p>
<p> For safe use, it is recommended to start with small quantities, monitor for adverse reactions, and consult a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with chronic illnesses or those taking other medications.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Cicer arietinum grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires consistent moisture during the growing season.  Farmers should ensure proper spacing between plants to promote air circulation and reduce the risk of disease, while regular weeding and pest control are essential for maintaining healthy growth.  Harvesting occurs when the pods turn a deep yellowish-brown and the seeds inside are fully mature, typically around 100 to 120 days after planting; the pods are harvested by hand or with mechanical tools to avoid damaging the plants.</p>
<p> To preserve potency, the seeds should be thoroughly dried in a cool, well-ventilated area before being stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to extend shelf life and maintain nutritional value.</p>
