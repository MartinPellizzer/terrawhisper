<h2 id="3">Side Effects of cicer arietinum</h2>
<p>Cicer arietinum leads gas because it contains complex carbohydrates, such as oligosaccharides, which are difficult for the human digestive system to break down, leading to fermentation in the gut and gas production.</p>
<p>Cicer arietinum causes diarrhea because the undigested carbohydrates can draw water into the intestines, increasing bowel movement frequency and looseness.</p>
<p>Cicer arietinum causes gas again due to the same oligosaccharides that remain undigested and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases like hydrogen and methane.</p>
<p>Cicer arietinum causes bloating because the gas buildup in the gastrointestinal tract from fermentation and the increased water content in the intestines can lead to a feeling of fullness and distension.</p>
