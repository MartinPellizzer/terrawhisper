<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Echinacea purpurea phytosterols, such as stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol, are known for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby supporting the body's immune response. In addition to phytosterols, echinacea contains saponins, which have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>Saponins also contribute to the herb's ability to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells. Another key constituent is caffeic acid, a phenolic compound with potent antioxidant and antiviral effects, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage and supports overall immune health. Rosmarinic acid, another important component, also exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, further reinforcing the herb's role in promoting immune resilience and reducing the risk of infections.</p>
<p>Together, these medicinal constituents make echinacea purpurea a valuable herbal remedy in traditional and modern medicine for its broad-spectrum health benefits.</p>
