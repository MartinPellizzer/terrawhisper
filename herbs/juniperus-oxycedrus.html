While it has been traditionally used for its diuretic and antiseptic properties, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, and in some cases, renal irritation or damage. It should not be used by individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions or those taking medications that affect kidney function, as it may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid its use due to the potential risk of harm to the fetus or infant, and it is contraindicated in patients with chronic illnesses that affect renal or hepatic function. To ensure safe use, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using juniperus oxycedrus, follow recommended dosages, and monitor for any adverse reactions, especially when combined with other herbs or medications.<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2>Juniperus oxycedrus grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring moderate water during the growing season. It is a hardy shrub that benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote air circulation, which helps prevent disease. The best time to harvest its berries is in late summer to early autumn when they turn dark blue and are fully mature, using clean pruning shears to cut the berries from the branches without damaging the plant. After harvesting, the berries should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area to preserve their potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated for longer shelf life. Proper care and storage ensure the medicinal properties of juniperus oxycedrus remain intact for use in herbal remedies.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Juniperus oxycedrus, also known as the common juniper, is a medicinal plant widely used for its therapeutic properties.
