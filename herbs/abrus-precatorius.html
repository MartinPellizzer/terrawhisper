                <h1>Abrus Precatorius</h1><p>Abrus precatorius, commonly known as the jequirity or rosary pea, has been traditionally used in various medicinal practices for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as rocurgine and abrin, which have been studied for their possible use in treating certain cancers and as a tool in medical research. However, due to the extreme toxicity of its seeds, its medicinal applications are limited and require strict handling to prevent poisoning. Despite its dangers, some traditional remedies have utilized the plant for pain relief and as an antiseptic.</p><p>Overall, while Abrus precatorius holds historical significance in alternative medicine, its use remains highly restricted due to safety concerns.</p>
