To maintain its health, remove dead or diseased leaves regularly and ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Harvesting should occur in late summer to early autumn when the plant's essential oils are most concentrated, using sharp scissors to cut the upper stems and leaves, avoiding damage to the roots.</p><p>After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good airflow, then stored in airtight containers in a dark, cool place to preserve its potency and medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Artemisia judaica, also known as sweet wormwood, is a medicinal plant commonly used for its potential health benefits.</p><p>Can I grow artemisia judaica at home?
