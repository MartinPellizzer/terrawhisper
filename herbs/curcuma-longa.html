<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Curcuma longa fights inflammation by containing curcumin, a compound that inhibits inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and COX-2, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6.</p>
<p>It reduces arthritis by decreasing joint inflammation and cartilage degradation through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help alleviate pain and improve joint function. It combats diabetes by enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting glucose uptake in cells, thanks to its ability to modulate key metabolic pathways involved in blood sugar regulation. It lowers blood pressure by improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress, which helps relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.</p>
<p>It improves digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and bile, aiding in the breakdown of food and enhancing nutrient absorption.</p>

<p>Curcuma longa causes stomach upset due to its active compound, curcumin, which can irritate the gastrointestinal tract in some individuals.</p>
<p>This herb may lead to nausea as it affects the digestive system and can slow down gastric emptying. Bloating and gas are also common side effects, as curcuma longa can alter the normal digestion process and increase intestinal fermentation.</p>
<p>It can induce stomach pain and abdominal cramps by stimulating the muscles in the digestive tract, leading to discomfort. Additionally, curcuma longa may trigger heartburn and lead to diarrhea in sensitive individuals, as it can increase the motility of the intestines and disrupt the balance of gut flora. These side effects are often mild and temporary, but they can be more severe in people with pre-existing digestive conditions or when consumed in high doses.</p>
<p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating curcuma longa into one’s diet, especially if experiencing persistent digestive issues.</p>
