In many cultures, the Cassia Tree holds deep spiritual significance, often featured in religious festivals, weddings, and purification rituals, symbolizing renewal, fertility, and divine blessings.

Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. To ensure optimal growth, periodic pruning and weeding are recommended, along with mulching to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds. The leaves and flowers are harvested during the flowering season, typically in spring to early summer, by gently cutting the branches to avoid damaging the plant.</p><p>After collection, the plant parts should be thoroughly dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area to preserve their medicinal potency, and then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their active compounds.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Cassia fistula, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a medicinal plant widely used for its therapeutic properties.</p><p>It can be grown at home in warm climates, requiring well-drained soil and ample sunlight, making it a feasible option for home cultivation.
