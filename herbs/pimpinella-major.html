<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Pimpinella major can be used medicinally for its potential anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and carminative properties, but its safety profile requires careful consideration.</p>

<p> To ensure safe use, always follow recommended dosages, consult with a qualified healthcare professional, and avoid long-term or excessive use without medical supervision.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Pimpinella major grows in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter, preferring full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p> It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall, requiring regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged.  To ensure healthy growth, it should be planted in early spring after the last frost, with rows spaced 30-45 cm apart to allow for adequate air circulation and root development.  Harvesting should occur in late summer to early autumn when the seeds are fully mature, using a sickle or hand shears to cut the stems just above the soil line.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good airflow to preserve its potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to maintain its medicinal properties.</p>
