<img src="/images/herbs/chelidonium-majus-benefits-boosts-immune-system.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with boosts immune system?</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus boosts immune system because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds exhibit immunomodulatory properties that enhance the body's defense mechanisms. Alkaloids like chelidonine have been shown to stimulate immune cell activity. Flavonoids contribute by reducing inflammation and supporting overall immune function.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents help strengthen the body's ability to fight off infections and diseases.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Reduces fever high</h2>
<p>Fever High, also known as elevated body temperature or hyperthermia, is a condition characterized by an increased core body temperature beyond the normal range.</p>
<p>It is typically caused by infections, inflammation, or immune responses to pathogens, and is commonly experienced by individuals with viral or bacterial illnesses.</p>
<p>Chelidonium majus, also known as greater celandine, has been traditionally used to help reduce fever due to its anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties.</p>
<p>The plant may support the body's natural cooling mechanisms and aid in lowering body temperature during febrile episodes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment for fever.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/chelidonium-majus-benefits-reduces-fever-high.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with reduces fever high?</h2>
<p>Chelidonium majus reduces fever high because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds possess anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Alkaloids like chelidonine help regulate body temperature by influencing the hypothalamus. Flavonoids contribute to reducing fever by enhancing metabolic processes and antioxidant activity.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents support the body's natural mechanisms to lower fever effectively.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Reduces muscle spasm</h2>
<p>Muscle spasm is an involuntary contraction of muscle fibers that can cause pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Also known as muscle cramp or spasticity, this condition often results from overuse, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or nerve irritation.</p>
<p>It commonly affects athletes, individuals with neurological disorders, and those undergoing physical therapy.</p>
