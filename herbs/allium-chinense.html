<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Allium chinense alliin is a key sulfur-containing compound found in this medicinal herb, which plays a crucial role in its pharmacological properties.</p>
<p>When the plant is damaged, alliin is converted into allicin, a well-known compound responsible for the pungent aroma and many of the health benefits associated with garlic. Allicin is known for its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular protective effects, making it a valuable component in traditional and modern medicine.</p>
<p>In addition to alliin and allicin, Allium chinense contains glucosinolates, which are sulfur-rich compounds that contribute to its detoxifying and anti-cancer properties. The herb also contains flavonoids, which are antioxidant compounds that help reduce oxidative stress and support immune function.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Allium chinense a versatile herbal remedy with a wide range of therapeutic applications.</p>
