<p>0 to 8. 0, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established.  It is drought-tolerant and prefers warm climates, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.  For optimal growth, regular pruning to encourage branching and remove dead wood is recommended, along with occasional fertilization during the growing season.  The leaves and roots are typically harvested during the dry season when the plant's active compounds are most concentrated, using clean tools to cut the stems or dig up the roots carefully to avoid damage.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be thoroughly dried in the shade to prevent mold, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to preserve its medicinal potency.</p>
