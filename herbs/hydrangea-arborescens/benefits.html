<p>Together, these constituents may help regulate blood pressure and reduce the risk of hypertension-related complications.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Treats gout symptoms</h2>
<p>Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and tenderness in joints.</p>
<p>Also known as gouty arthritis, this condition is caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints and surrounding tissues.</p>
<p>Uric acid forms when the body breaks down substances called purines, which are found in certain foods and drinks.</p>
<p>Individuals who commonly experience gout include those with a family history of the condition, people who consume excessive alcohol or high-purine diets, and individuals with kidney disease.</p>
<p>Hydrangea arborescens, also known as smooth hydrangea, has been studied for its potential to alleviate gout symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/hydrangea-arborescens-benefits-treats-gout-symptoms.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">

The alkaloids in the plant may inhibit enzymes involved in uric acid production, while flavonoids act as antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress. These natural compounds work synergistically to alleviate pain and swelling associated with gout.</p>
<p>As a result, hydrangea arborescens is considered a potential herbal remedy for managing gout symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Treats arthritis symptoms</h2>
<p>Arthritis is a chronic condition characterized by joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness.</p>
<p>Also known as joint disease or rheumatic disorder, it affects the musculoskeletal system.</p>
<p>It is often caused by wear and tear of cartilage, autoimmune responses, or genetic factors.</p>
<p>This condition commonly affects older adults, particularly those over the age of 60.</p>
<p>Hydrangea arborescens has been studied for its potential to alleviate arthritis symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/hydrangea-arborescens-benefits-treats-arthritis-symptoms.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with treats arthritis symptoms?</h2>
<p>Hydrangea arborescens treats arthritis symptoms because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids, which possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
