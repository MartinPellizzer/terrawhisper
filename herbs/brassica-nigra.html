<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Brassica nigra glucosinolate is a key bioactive compound found in the seeds of the black mustard plant, known for its potent health benefits.</p>
<p>These sulfur-containing compounds are converted into isothiocyanates during digestion, which exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. One of the primary derivatives, allyl isothiocyanate, is responsible for the pungent flavor of mustard and has been studied for its potential anticancer effects.</p>
<p>Sinigrin, another glucosinolate present in Brassica nigra, acts as a precursor to isothiocyanates and also contributes to the plant's defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens. Isothiocyanates, derived from both glucosinolates and sinigrin, have shown promise in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and supporting detoxification processes in the body.</p>
<p>Together, these compounds make Brassica nigra a valuable herb in traditional and modern medicine for their therapeutic potential.</p>
