<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Cyclopia intermedia can be used as a medicinal plant, but it is important to be aware of its safety profile, potential side effects, and contraindications.</p>

It is important to note that cyclopia intermedia may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system, and may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants or antidiabetic drugs.  Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid its use due to limited safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, always follow recommended dosages, consult with a qualified healthcare professional, and avoid prolonged use without medical supervision.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Cyclopia intermedia grows in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires regular watering during the growing season but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.  It thrives in temperate climates and benefits from mulching to retain moisture and suppress weeds.  Regular pruning of dead or diseased branches and monitoring for pests like aphids are essential for maintaining plant health and promoting vigorous growth.  Harvesting is best done in late spring to early summer when the leaves are fully developed, using clean shears to cut the stems just above the base to encourage regrowth.</p>
<p> To preserve its potency, the harvested plant should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good air circulation, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain its medicinal properties.</p>
