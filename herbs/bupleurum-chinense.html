It thrives in temperate climates and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. To ensure healthy growth, regular weeding and mulching are recommended, along with occasional fertilization to support robust foliage and root development. The plant is typically harvested in the autumn when the roots are mature and most potent, using a spade to carefully dig up the roots without damaging them. After harvesting, the roots should be thoroughly washed, dried in a cool, shaded area, and stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve their medicinal potency.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Bupleurum chinense is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential health benefits, including supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation.
