<p>Sambucus nigra lignans, like secoisolariciresinol, have been studied for their potential anti-cancer and liver-protective properties, as well as their role in modulating gut microbiota.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of sambucus nigra</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra fruit, also known as elderberry, is widely used in herbal medicine for its high antioxidant content and immune-supporting properties.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe and can be used to make syrups, teas, and tinctures.</p>

<p>Sambucus nigra tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the plant material in alcohol, providing a potent form of the herb for internal or topical use.</p>
<p>Sambucus nigra syrups are typically made by combining the decoction or tincture with sugar or honey, offering a palatable and sweetened form for easier consumption, especially by children or those with a preference for sweet flavors.</p>
