                <h1>Serenoa Repens</h1><p>Serenoa repens, commonly known as saw palmetto, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p><p>It has been widely used in traditional medicine for centuries, particularly for its potential benefits in supporting urinary and prostate health. The fruit of the plant is typically harvested and dried for use in various formulations, including capsules, tinctures, and teas. Modern research suggests that saw palmetto may help reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).</p><p>Due to its natural origin and purported health benefits, Serenoa repens remains a popular herbal remedy in both alternative and complementary medicine practices.</p>
