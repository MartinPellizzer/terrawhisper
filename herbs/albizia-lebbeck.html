The tree holds deep cultural significance in various traditions, where it is often associated with spiritual growth, harmony, and renewal, and is featured in rituals and folk stories that emphasize its connection to the divine.

The recommended dosage for adults is typically 200-400 mg of standardized extract in capsule form, taken two to three times daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision.</p><p>Due to the lack of long-term studies, it is advisable to use it for short durations and consult a healthcare provider before prolonged use.</p><h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Albizia lebbeck can be used as a medicinal plant for its calming and anxiolytic properties, but it should be used with caution due to limited long-term safety data.</p><p>Potential side effects include drowsiness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and in rare cases, allergic reactions. It may interact with sedatives, antidepressants, and other central nervous system depressants, increasing the risk of drowsiness or respiratory depression.

For optimal care, regular pruning of dead or diseased branches and occasional fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer can enhance its health and yield. Harvesting is best done when the pods turn from green to yellowish-brown, typically 3 to 4 months after planting, using hand-picking or cutting with a sickle to avoid damaging the plant.</p><p>To preserve its potency, the harvested pods should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Albizia lebbeck, also known as the silk tree or Indian laburnum, is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional medicine for its calming and anxiolytic properties.</p><p>If you're wondering, can I grow albizia lebbeck at home?
