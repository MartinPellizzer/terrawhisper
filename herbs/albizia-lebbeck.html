The recommended dosage for adults is typically 200-400 mg of standardized extract in capsule form, taken two to three times daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision.</p><p>Due to the lack of long-term studies, it is advisable to use it for short durations and consult a healthcare provider before prolonged use.</p><h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Albizia lebbeck can be used as a medicinal plant for its calming and anxiolytic properties, but it should be used with caution due to limited long-term safety data.</p><p>Potential side effects include drowsiness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and in rare cases, allergic reactions.

For optimal care, regular pruning of dead or diseased branches and occasional fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer can enhance its health and yield. Harvesting is best done when the pods turn from green to yellowish-brown, typically 3 to 4 months after planting, using hand-picking or cutting with a sickle to avoid damaging the plant.</p><p>To preserve its potency, the harvested pods should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Albizia lebbeck, also known as the silk tree or Indian laburnum, is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional medicine for its calming and anxiolytic properties.</p><p>If you're wondering, can I grow albizia lebbeck at home?
