<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Larrea tridentata reduces inflammation by containing compounds like flavonoids and triterpenes that inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and 5-LOX, thereby decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the body.</p>
<p>It lowers blood pressure by acting as a natural vasodilator, improving blood flow and reducing the workload on the heart, while also containing antioxidants that help relax blood vessels and reduce arterial stiffness. It fights viral infections due to its high concentration of antimicrobial and antiviral compounds, such as nordihydroguaiaretic acid, which disrupt viral replication and enhance the immune response against pathogens. It fights cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting angiogenesis, and reducing oxidative stress, with its bioactive compounds like luteolin and quercetin playing key roles in targeting and destroying malignant cells.</p>
<p>It cures fungal infections because of its potent antifungal properties, primarily due to the presence of compounds like berberine and flavonoids, which inhibit fungal growth and prevent the spread of infections.</p>
