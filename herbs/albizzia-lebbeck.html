<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Albizzia lebbeck can be used as a medicinal plant for its potential calming and anxiolytic properties, but its safety profile requires careful consideration.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in recommended doses, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, drowsiness, or mild allergic reactions in some individuals.  It should be used with caution in combination with other herbs or medications, as it may interact with sedatives, antidepressants, or anticoagulants, potentially increasing their effects or causing adverse reactions.  Special populations, including pregnant or breastfeeding women and individuals with chronic illnesses, should avoid albizzia lebbeck due to insufficient evidence on its safety and potential risks to fetal or infant development.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, consult a healthcare professional before starting any regimen, follow recommended dosages, and monitor for any adverse reactions.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Albizzia lebbeck grows best in well-drained, loamy soils with a pH ranging from 6.</p>
<p>0 to 7. 5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires regular watering during its establishment phase.  It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring warm temperatures and moderate humidity, with occasional drought tolerance once established.  Regular pruning and fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promote healthy growth and enhance the quality of its medicinal properties.  Harvesting is best done during the dry season, when the leaves and pods are mature, using clean tools to avoid contamination and ensure minimal damage to the plant.</p>
<p> For storage, the harvested material should be dried thoroughly in a shaded, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to preserve its potency and extend shelf life.</p>
