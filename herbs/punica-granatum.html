Ellagic acid, in particular, is known for its potential anticancer properties and ability to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells. The presence of flavonoids also supports cardiovascular health by improving blood flow and reducing cholesterol levels.</p><p>Overall, the combination of these bioactive constituents makes Punica granatum a valuable resource in the development of natural remedies and therapeutic treatments.</p><h2 id="3">Preparations</h2><p>Punica granatum has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and topical oils, that have been used for centuries in traditional medicine.</p><p>Pomegranate tea is often prepared by steeping the fruit's peel or seeds in hot water, and it is valued for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Prolonged use of pomegranate juice or supplements may lead to interactions with certain medications, particularly blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding. Excessive consumption might also contribute to tooth enamel erosion due to its high acidity.</p><p>However, when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, pomegranate is generally considered safe and beneficial for most people.</p>
