<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Journal of ethnopharmacology", Cassia senna does not appear to be the main topic, as the study actually refers to Cassia italica, however Cassia species have been found to reduce inflammation in a positive way as the ethanolic extract of Cassia italica reduced carrageenin-induced paw swelling (31%) and fever (37%) in rats.</p>

<h2 id="8">9. Lowers blood pressure</h2>
<p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic condition characterized by elevated pressure in the arteries.</p>
<p>This condition can lead to serious health complications if left untreated.</p>
