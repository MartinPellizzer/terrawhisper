Reduces inflammation</h2><p>Cassia senna reduces inflammation by containing active compounds such as anthraquinones, which have potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These compounds work by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reducing oxidative stress in the body. This makes Cassia senna beneficial for conditions like arthritis, skin inflammation, and gastrointestinal disorders.

Lowers cholesterol</h2><p>Cassia senna lowers cholesterol by promoting the excretion of bile acids from the body, which in turn increases the liver's demand for cholesterol to produce more bile.</p><p>This process helps reduce the overall levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, in the bloodstream. Studies have suggested that the bioactive compounds in Cassia senna, such as sennosides, may contribute to this cholesterol-lowering effect.

This natural remedy is often used as a complementary therapy for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes.</p><p>Regular use of Cassia senna, under medical guidance, can contribute to better glycemic control and overall metabolic health.</p><h2>9. Promotes detoxification</h2><p>Cassia senna promotes detoxification by stimulating the digestive system and encouraging the elimination of toxins through the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Its active compounds, such as anthraquinones, act as natural laxatives, helping to remove accumulated waste and harmful substances from the body.

The herb is known to reduce cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, thereby alleviating symptoms of anxiety and tension. Regular use of Cassia senna may enhance resilience to stress and improve overall mental health.</p><p>As a natural remedy, it offers a gentle and effective way to manage daily stress without the side effects associated with synthetic medications.</p>
