It thrives in warm climates with temperatures between 18°C and 25°C, and should be planted in spring after the last frost.  Regular watering is necessary, but the soil should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.  To maintain healthy growth, prune back any dead or diseased foliage and fertilize with a balanced organic fertilizer every 4 to 6 weeks during the growing season.  Harvesting should occur in the early morning when the leaves are fully hydrated, using clean, sharp shears to cut the stems just above the base, ensuring minimal damage to the plant.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the leaves should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area to preserve their potency, then stored in airtight glass containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to extend shelf life.</p>
