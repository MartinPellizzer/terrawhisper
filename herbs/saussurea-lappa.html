<p>Saussurea lappa reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as sesquiterpenes and flavonoids, which inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppress the activity of enzymes like COX-2, thereby decreasing swelling and pain.</p>
<p>It treats fever by acting as a natural antipyretic, helping to regulate body temperature through its ability to enhance the body's metabolic processes and promote the excretion of toxins. It soothes digestion by stimulating the secretion of digestive enzymes and reducing gastrointestinal spasms, which helps alleviate symptoms like bloating and indigestion. It treats gout by lowering uric acid levels in the blood, which reduces the formation of urate crystals in the joints and mitigates inflammation and pain associated with gout.</p>
<p>It cures ulcers by promoting the secretion of mucus in the stomach lining and protecting the gastric mucosa from the harmful effects of acid, thus facilitating healing and preventing further damage.</p>
