<p>Vinca rosea vincristine is another alkaloid that functions similarly by binding to tubulin and interfering with microtubule dynamics, effectively arresting cell division at the metaphase stage and is widely used in treating leukemia and lymphoma.</p>
<p>Vinca rosea vindesine is a third alkaloid with a similar mechanism of action, inhibiting microtubule polymerization and disrupting the mitotic spindle, and is often used in combination chemotherapy regimens for various cancers.</p>
<p>Vinca rosea phenolic acids, such as chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid, exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the plant's potential therapeutic effects beyond its alkaloidal constituents.</p>
