<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Vinca rosea leaf has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>The leaves contain bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, which contribute to their medicinal value.
