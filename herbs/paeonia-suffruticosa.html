The best time to harvest its roots is in the fall after the plant has fully matured, typically between September and November, using a spade or shovel to carefully excavate the rhizomes without damaging them.</p>
<p> To preserve its potency, the harvested roots should be thoroughly washed, sliced, and dried in a cool, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain their medicinal properties.</p>
