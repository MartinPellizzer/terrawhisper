<p>Pygeum africanum b-sitosterol glucoside is a key bioactive compound found in the bark of the African plum tree, known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties, which contribute to its traditional use in treating prostate-related conditions.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum lup-20, a triterpene compound, exhibits strong anti-inflammatory effects and has been shown to inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone linked to prostate enlargement.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum sitosterol, a plant-derived phytosterol, functions as a natural anti-inflammatory agent and helps reduce swelling and irritation in the prostate gland by modulating cellular membrane fluidity and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum fatty acids, particularly the unsaturated fatty acids, contribute to the herb's overall anti-inflammatory profile and support cellular health by reducing inflammation and improving metabolic function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of pygeum africanum</h2>
<p>Pygeum africanum teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried bark of the tree in hot water for several minutes, allowing the active compounds such as sterols and triterpenes to be extracted, making it a popular choice for its purported benefits in supporting prostate health.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum decoctions involve boiling the bark for a longer period, which increases the concentration of bioactive components and is often used for more intensive therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Pygeum africanum tinctures are made by soaking the bark in alcohol, which preserves the active ingredients and allows for a more concentrated and easily absorbed form of the herb.</p>
