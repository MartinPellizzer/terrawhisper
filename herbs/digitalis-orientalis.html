<h2 id="0">Medicinal Constituents of digitalis orientalis</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis cardenolides are a class of cardiac glycosides that include compounds such as digoxin and digitoxin, which exhibit potent inotropic effects by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, thereby increasing intracellular calcium levels and enhancing myocardial contractility.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis saponins are triterpene glycosides that possess mild diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the herb's traditional use in treating cardiovascular and respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis phytosterols, such as stigmasterol and campesterol, are plant sterols that may help lower cholesterol levels and support cardiovascular health by modulating lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis sterols, including beta-sitosterol, are known for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, which may contribute to the herb's therapeutic potential in various inflammatory conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts of digitalis orientalis</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis leaf contains cardiac glycosides, which are used in herbal medicine for their potential cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>The leaf is primarily used to prepare tinctures and decoctions that may support heart function.</p>
<p>The seeds of Digitalis orientalis contain alkaloids and are often used in formulations for their purported tonic and stimulant properties.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations from these parts include tinctures, decoctions, and possibly powder forms, though their use is limited due to the plant's toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of digitalis orientalis</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis decoctions are traditionally prepared by simmering the dried leaves and flowers of the plant in water for an extended period, allowing the active compounds, such as digoxin and digitoxin, to be extracted, making them a potent preparation used for cardiovascular support.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis teas are made by steeping the dried plant material in hot water for a shorter time, resulting in a milder preparation that is often consumed for its calming and heart-related benefits.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the plant in alcohol, which enhances the bioavailability of its cardiac glycosides and is commonly used in herbal medicine for treating heart conditions.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis capsules contain dried plant material encapsulated for convenience, offering a standardized dosage and easy administration, though they are less commonly used due to the herb's potent nature and potential toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of digitalis orientalis</h2>
<p>Digitalis orientalis vision blurs because the herb contains cardiac glycosides that can affect the nervous system and cause visual disturbances.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis heart beats slow due to its ability to increase the force of heart contractions and decrease heart rate by affecting the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis fatigue occurs as a result of the herb's impact on the cardiovascular system, which can reduce the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the body's tissues.</p>
<p>Digitalis orientalis dry mouth is caused by the herb's effect on the autonomic nervous system, which can reduce saliva production.</p>
