                <h1>Rhus Chinensis</h1><p>Rhus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese sumac, has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for its various therapeutic properties.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, which contribute to its medicinal effects. It is often employed to treat skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis, due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Additionally, Rhus chinensis has been used to alleviate symptoms of rheumatism and arthritis, thanks to its ability to reduce swelling and pain.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested in large amounts, and its use should be carefully monitored under professional guidance.</p>
