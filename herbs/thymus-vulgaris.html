<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Thymus vulgaris fights bacterial infections due to its high concentration of thymol and carvacrol, which exhibit strong antimicrobial properties by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria, thereby inhibiting their growth and survival.</p>
<p>It supports the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells, particularly T-cells, which are essential for identifying and destroying pathogens. It reduces inflammation by inhibiting the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, thereby decreasing swelling and pain in inflamed tissues. It enhances digestive health by promoting the secretion of digestive enzymes and improving gut motility, which aids in the breakdown and absorption of nutrients.</p>
<p>It has antioxidant properties because it contains compounds like rosmarinic acid and flavonoids that neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and protecting cells from damage.</p>

<p>The 10 best health benefits of Thymus vulgaris are shown in the image below.</p>
