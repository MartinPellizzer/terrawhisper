Flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol are known for their ability to neutralize free radicals and protect cellular structures. Phenolic acids, including ferulic and p-coumaric acid, further enhance the plant's therapeutic value by modulating inflammatory responses.</p><p>Saponins, on the other hand, have demonstrated cholesterol-lowering effects and may support cardiovascular health, highlighting the diverse pharmacological applications of Elymus repens.</p><h2>Medicinal Preparations</h2><p>Elymus repens has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and poultices, that have been traditionally used for their therapeutic properties.</p><p>The leaves and roots of this plant are often dried and steeped into teas to help alleviate digestive issues and reduce inflammation.
