<h2 id="1">Scientific and Botanical Profile</h2>Pilose Agrimony, with botanical name Agrimonia pilosa, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rosaceae, known for its diverse common names such as Common Agrimony, Common St. Johnswort, Sticky Willie, and St. John's Wort. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its distinctive, woolly, yellow flower heads that resemble a stag's head or horn, hence its other names like Stag's Head, Stag's Tooth, and Stag's Horn. The plant produces small, five-lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark brown, spherical fruits. Native to a wide range of regions including Europe, Asia, North America, Central Asia, South America, the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, Australia, the Pacific Islands, and the Arctic Regions, Agrimonia pilosa is also known by names such as Bladder Campion, Woolly Agrimony, Yellow Agrimony, Wooly Cinquefoil, Fiveleaf Agrimony, Agromonia, and Field Agrimony.<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2>Pilose Agrimony was used in ancient herbal medicine systems across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East for its purported healing properties. It has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine, where it was valued for its ability to aid digestion and reduce inflammation, and in European folk medicine, where it was often used to treat stomach ailments and as a mild astringent. In medieval times, it was incorporated into herbal remedies for wounds and skin conditions, and it played a role in various folk rituals, such as being burned to ward off evil spirits or used in purification ceremonies. Today, its dried flowers and leaves are still used in herbal teas and tinctures to support digestive health and alleviate mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The plant's enduring presence in traditional healing practices highlights its cultural significance and its continued relevance in holistic wellness approaches.<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2>Pilose Agrimony contains a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenes, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It is also rich in essential oils, which provide antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and contains alkaloids that may influence various physiological processes. Nutritionally, Pilose Agrimony is a good source of vitamins such as vitamin C and some B-complex vitamins, along with minerals like potassium, calcium, and iron. These compounds work synergistically to enhance the plant's antioxidant capacity, supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress in the body. Its mechanism of action involves modulating inflammatory pathways and protecting cellular structures, making it a valuable herbal remedy in traditional medicine.<h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2>Agrimonia pilosa has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, making it beneficial for the digestive, respiratory, and immune systems. It is particularly effective in treating gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and indigestion due to its ability to regulate intestinal motility and reduce inflammation in the gut lining. Compared to similar herbs like goldenseal or senna, agrimonia pilosa offers a more gentle and sustained action, with a lower risk of causing gastrointestinal irritation. Its unique advantage lies in its ability to support both the digestive and immune systems simultaneously, enhancing overall wellness. Additionally, agrimonia pilosa is known for its mild diuretic effects, which can aid in detoxification and kidney health, making it a versatile herb with broader therapeutic applications than many of its counterparts.<p>Discover the <a href="/herbs/agrimonia-pilosa/benefits.html">10 best health benefits of Pilose Agrimony</a>.</p><h2 id="5">Forms, Preparation and Usage</h2>Agrimonia pilosa has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties, and it is available in various forms including fresh leaves, dried tincture, powder, essential oil, and capsule. To prepare agrimonia pilosa, it can be made into a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or a decoction can be made by boiling the plant material for a longer period. It can also be used as an infusion or applied topically for skin conditions. The recommended dosage for adults is typically 1-2 grams of dried herb per cup of water, taken up to three times daily, while children should only use it if safe and under medical supervision. Due to its potent nature, it is advisable to use agrimonia pilosa sparingly and for short durations, typically no longer than two weeks, unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional.<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2>Agrimonia pilosa can be used as a medicinal plant with potential benefits for digestive and inflammatory conditions, but it is important to consider its safety profile. While generally considered safe when used in recommended doses, agrimonia pilosa may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, or allergic reactions in some individuals. It may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding or reducing the effectiveness of these treatments. Special populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should avoid agrimonia pilosa due to limited safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use. To ensure safe use, it is advisable to start with small doses, monitor for adverse effects, and consult with a qualified healthcare professional before incorporating agrimonia pilosa into one's regimen.<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2>Agrimonia pilosa grows best in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring regular watering during dry periods. It prefers a temperate climate with moderate temperatures and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. For optimal growth, it should be planted in spring after the last frost, with spacing to allow for adequate air circulation and root development. Regular weeding and occasional pruning to remove dead or diseased foliage can help maintain its health and promote vigorous growth. The plant is typically harvested in late summer to early autumn when the stems and leaves are most potent, using clean shears to cut the tops of the plant, ensuring minimal damage to the roots. After harvesting, the material should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good airflow to preserve its medicinal compounds, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain potency and extend shelf life.<h2 id="8">FAQ</h2>Agrimonia pilosa, also known as common agrimony, is a medicinal plant widely used for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. It can be grown at home in well-drained soil with full sun exposure, making it a suitable choice for gardeners interested in cultivating medicinal herbs. The effects of agrimonia pilosa typically become noticeable within a few weeks of regular use, though results may vary depending on the individual and the dosage. It can be combined with other herbs such as ginger or peppermint to enhance its therapeutic effects, but it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before mixing supplements. While agrimonia pilosa is generally safe for short-term use, long-term safety has not been extensively studied, so it is recommended to use it under medical supervision.
