<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of leonurus cardiaca</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca glycosides are a group of bioactive compounds found in the herb, primarily responsible for its cardiovascular effects, with compounds such as leonurin and leonuridine being the most notable, exhibiting properties that support heart function and may help regulate cardiac rhythm.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca cardiac glycosides are a specific subset of these glycosides, known for their ability to inhibit the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, thereby increasing intracellular sodium and calcium levels, which enhances myocardial contractility and is used in the treatment of heart failure.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca glutamic acid contributes to the herb's overall physiological effects by acting as a neurotransmitter precursor and playing a role in energy metabolism and nerve function, supporting both cardiovascular and neurological health.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca cardiotonic glycosides are a class of compounds that specifically enhance cardiac output by strengthening heart contractions, making them valuable in therapeutic applications for conditions involving weakened heart function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of leonurus cardiaca</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca root is primarily used for its tonic and circulatory benefits, often prepared as a tincture or decoction to support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>The leaves are commonly used in teas or infusions to promote diuresis and alleviate menstrual discomfort.</p>
<p>The flowers, though less frequently used, can be added to herbal infusions for their mild sedative and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations from these parts include root tinctures, leaf teas, and flower-infused oils, each tailored to address specific therapeutic needs.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of leonurus cardiaca</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca decoctions are commonly prepared by simmering the dried herb in water for an extended period, allowing the extraction of its active compounds such as leonurine and flavonoids, which are believed to support cardiovascular health and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca teas are typically made by steeping the dried leaves and flowers in hot water for several minutes, offering a mild, aromatic beverage that is often consumed for its calming effects and potential to improve circulation.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts made by soaking the herb in alcohol or glycerin, providing a potent form of the herb that is often used for its purported benefits in treating heart-related conditions and stress.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca capsules are standardized, convenient formulations that contain dried herb powder, making them a popular choice for daily supplementation to support heart health and overall vitality.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of leonurus cardiaca</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca induces vomiting due to its irritant compounds that stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, leading to nausea and emesis.</p>
<p>The herb can cause skin irritation because it contains compounds that may trigger allergic reactions or dermatitis upon contact with the skin.</p>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca causes heart palpitations as it may affect the cardiovascular system, potentially altering heart rhythm through its impact on cardiac receptors.</p>
<p>The herb induces rapid heartbeat due to its potential to increase sympathetic nervous system activity, which can elevate heart rate and lead to tachycardia.</p>
