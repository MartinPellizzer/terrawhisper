</ol>
<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca glycosides are a group of bioactive compounds found in the herb commonly known as heart herb or red clover.</p>
<p>These glycosides, including cardiac glycosides and cardiotonic glycosides, are known for their potent effects on the cardiovascular system. Cardiac glycosides, in particular, work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cardiac muscle cells, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium levels, which enhance myocardial contractility.</p>
<p>This makes them valuable in the treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias. In addition to glycosides, Leonurus cardiaca also contains other beneficial constituents such as glutamic acid, an amino acid that plays a role in nerve function and energy production. Together, these compounds contribute to the herb's reputation as a traditional remedy for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>The combination of glycosides and other nutrients in Leonurus cardiaca makes it a subject of ongoing research for its potential therapeutic applications in modern medicine.</p>
