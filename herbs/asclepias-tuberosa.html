<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Asclepias tuberosa reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and alkaloids that inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes like COX-2, which are responsible for triggering inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system due to its high concentration of antioxidants and phytochemicals that enhance the activity of immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells, helping the body defend against infections and diseases. It reduces joint inflammation by modulating the inflammatory pathways in the joints, thereby alleviating conditions like arthritis and rheumatism by decreasing the activity of inflammatory mediators. It heals skin issues because of its antimicrobial and wound-healing properties, which promote the regeneration of skin cells and prevent infections in damaged or inflamed skin.</p>
<p>It soothes muscle pain by acting as a natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent, which helps reduce muscle spasms and discomfort by improving blood circulation and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
