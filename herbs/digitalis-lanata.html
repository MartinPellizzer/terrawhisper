<p>Digitalis lanata, commonly known as the foxglove, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family, known for its striking bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>This herb has been historically used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits, including strengthening heart contractions and regulating heart rate.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents responsible for its therapeutic actions include cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and lanatoside C, which affect the heart's electrical activity.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as infusions, tinctures, and extracts can be made from the dried leaves and flowers, though caution is required due to its potent nature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 32px;">This page analize the most important medicinal aspects of Digitalis lanata.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits of digitalis lanata</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata slow heart rate by increasing the force of cardiac contractions and decreasing the speed of electrical signals in the heart, which results in a slower heart rate.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata treat atrial fibrillation by helping to control the irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs in this condition, thereby reducing the risk of complications.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata regulate heartbeat by affecting the electrical conduction system of the heart, specifically by slowing the conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata lower ventricular rate by enhancing the effect of the AV node in delaying the transmission of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of digitalis lanata</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata triterpenoids are a class of compounds found in the plant that contribute to its pharmacological activity, though they are less studied compared to other constituents like cardiac glycosides; these triterpenoids may play a role in modulating cellular processes and have shown some anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties in preliminary research.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata digoxin is a potent cardiac glycoside that acts by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium, which in turn affects calcium levels and enhances myocardial contractility, making it effective in treating heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata digitoxin is another cardiac glycoside with a similar mechanism of action to digoxin, but it has a higher affinity for the sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme and is often used in the treatment of chronic heart failure and certain types of arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata cardiac glycosides, including digoxin and digitoxin, are the primary medicinal constituents of the herb, responsible for its therapeutic effects on the cardiovascular system, and they are known for their ability to regulate heart rhythm and improve cardiac output.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of digitalis lanata</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata leaf contains cardiac glycosides, which are responsible for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaf is primarily used for its ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rhythm.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from the leaf include tinctures, decoctions, and powdered forms, which are traditionally used in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its high toxicity, the leaf must be handled with extreme caution and only under professional guidance.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of digitalis lanata</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts prepared by soaking the dried leaves and flowers of the plant in alcohol, which allows for the extraction of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and ouabain, making them effective for treating heart conditions.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata decoctions involve boiling the plant material in water to release its active compounds, often used in traditional medicine for their ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata capsules contain standardized extracts of the herb, offering a convenient and consistent dosage form for patients requiring long-term cardiac support.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata syrups are commonly used in pediatric and geriatric care, as they provide a palatable and easily measurable form of the herb, suitable for those who have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of digitalis lanata</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata heart beats fast because it contains cardiac glycosides that increase the force of heart contractions and can disrupt the heart's electrical activity, leading to a faster heart rate.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata blood pressure drops because the herb can cause vasodilation, which widens blood vessels and reduces the resistance to blood flow.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata blood pressure rises due to its ability to increase cardiac output and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which can elevate blood pressure in some cases.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata eyesight blurs because the herb can affect the retina and optic nerve, leading to visual disturbances such as blurred vision.</p>
