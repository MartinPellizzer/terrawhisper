<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata triterpenoids are a class of secondary metabolites found in the plant, contributing to its pharmacological profile.</p>
<p>While triterpenoids are known for their diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, they are not the primary active compounds responsible for the herb's cardiac effects. The main medicinal constituents of Digitalis lanata are cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin and digitoxin, which are potent inhibitors of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump.</p>
<p>These glycosides increase intracellular sodium levels, leading to a cascade of events that enhance myocardial contractility, making them valuable in the treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias. Digoxin, in particular, is widely used in clinical settings due to its ability to regulate heart rhythm and improve cardiac output. Digitoxin, although less commonly used today, shares a similar mechanism of action and has been historically employed for similar therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>Together, these cardiac glycosides highlight the therapeutic importance of Digitalis lanata in cardiovascular medicine, despite the presence of other bioactive compounds like triterpenoids.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata leaf has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin and digitoxin, which are known to affect the heart's function. These compounds can help in treating heart conditions by increasing the force of heart contractions and slowing the heart rate. However, the leaves are highly toxic and require careful handling and precise dosing to avoid adverse effects.</p>
<p>Due to their potency, the leaves are typically processed or extracted to create safer medicinal formulations.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata tinctures are prepared by soaking the dried leaves and flowers of the plant in alcohol, allowing the active compounds, such as digoxin and digitoxin, to extract into the solvent.</p>
<p>These tinctures are commonly used in herbal medicine for their cardiovascular effects, including strengthening heart contractions and regulating heart rhythm. However, due to the potent and potentially toxic nature of the alkaloids, tinctures must be prepared and administered with extreme caution.</p>
<p>They are typically diluted further before use to minimize the risk of overdose. In contrast, decoctions involve boiling the plant material in water to create a concentrated herbal tea, which is less potent but still effective for mild cardiovascular support. Capsules and syrups offer more convenient forms for regular use, while mucillages, derived from the plant's mucilage-rich parts, are used topically as poultices to soothe skin irritations or reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Each preparation method has its own set of benefits and risks, requiring careful consideration and professional guidance for safe and effective use.</p>
