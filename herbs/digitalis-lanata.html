<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata slow heart rate by increasing the force of cardiac contractions and decreasing the speed of electrical signals in the heart, which results in a slower heart rate.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata treat atrial fibrillation by helping to control the irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs in this condition, thereby reducing the risk of complications.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata regulate heartbeat by affecting the electrical conduction system of the heart, specifically by slowing the conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata lower ventricular rate by enhancing the effect of the AV node in delaying the transmission of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles.</p>

<p>Below you find a list of the <a href="/herbs/digitalis-lanata/benefits.html">9 best health benefits of Digitalis lanata</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow Heart Rate</strong>: Digitalis lanata herb helps to slow down the heart rate by enhancing the force of heart contractions and reducing the electrical impulses in the heart.</li>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Digitalis lanata triterpenoids are a class of compounds found in the plant that contribute to its pharmacological activity, though they are less studied compared to other constituents like cardiac glycosides; these triterpenoids may play a role in modulating cellular processes and have shown some anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties in preliminary research.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata digoxin is a potent cardiac glycoside that acts by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium, which in turn affects calcium levels and enhances myocardial contractility, making it effective in treating heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata digitoxin is another cardiac glycoside with a similar mechanism of action to digoxin, but it has a higher affinity for the sodium-potassium ATPase enzyme and is often used in the treatment of chronic heart failure and certain types of arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Digitalis lanata cardiac glycosides, including digoxin and digitoxin, are the primary medicinal constituents of the herb, responsible for its therapeutic effects on the cardiovascular system, and they are known for their ability to regulate heart rhythm and improve cardiac output.</p>
