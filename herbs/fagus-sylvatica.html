                <h1>Fagus Sylvatica</h1><p>Fagus sylvatica, commonly known as the European beech, has been used in traditional medicine for centuries due to its various bioactive compounds.</p><p>The bark, leaves, and sap of the beech tree contain tannins, flavonoids, and mucilage, which have been utilized to treat ailments such as diarrhea, inflammation, and skin conditions. In modern pharmacology, extracts from Fagus sylvatica have shown potential in reducing oxidative stress and supporting immune function. Some studies suggest that its compounds may have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a subject of ongoing research in natural medicine.</p><p>Despite its historical use, further clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety in medicinal applications.</p>
