<h2 id="0">1. Heals wounds quickly</h2>
<p>Wound healing.</p>
<p>A condition characterized by the body's process of repairing damaged tissue, often resulting in inflammation, scarring, or delayed recovery.</p>
<p>This issue can be caused by physical trauma, surgical procedures, or chronic conditions like diabetes, which impair the body's natural repair mechanisms.</p>
<p>It commonly affects individuals recovering from injuries, post-surgical patients, and those with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Symphytum officinale, also known as common comfrey, is traditionally used to accelerate wound healing due to its high concentration of allantoin and mucilage, which promote cell regeneration and reduce inflammation.</p>
