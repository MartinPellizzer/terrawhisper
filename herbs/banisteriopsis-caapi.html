<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Banisteriopsis caapi stem is a key medicinal part of the Ayahuasca plant, known for its psychoactive and entheogenic properties.</p>
<p>The stem contains the alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is responsible for the profound psychoactive effects experienced during Ayahuasca ceremonies.</p>
<p>The leaf of Banisteriopsis caapi is also used medicinally, primarily for its monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibiting properties, which allow the DMT to remain active in the body when consumed.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from these parts include Ayahuasca brews, which are traditionally prepared by combining the stem with the leaves of other plants like Psychotria viridis to create a potent entheogenic tea.</p>
