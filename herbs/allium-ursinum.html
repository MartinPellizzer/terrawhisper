<p>It can also cause gas and bloating due to its effect on the digestive system, leading to discomfort and a feeling of fullness. Furthermore, Allium ursinum may trigger coughing and throat irritation, as the volatile oils can irritate the respiratory tract. In some cases, it may cause fatigue, possibly due to its impact on digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>
