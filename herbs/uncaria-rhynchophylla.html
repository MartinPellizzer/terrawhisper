<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Uncaria rhynchophylla fights against malaria by containing alkaloids such as rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, which interfere with the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite by inhibiting its ability to replicate within red blood cells.</p>
<p>It suppresses cancer cells through its ability to induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in malignant cells while preserving the integrity of healthy cells, thanks to its rich content of bioactive compounds like alkaloids and flavonoids. It reduces inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing the activity of enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are key drivers of inflammatory responses in the body. It prevents heart attacks by improving cardiovascular function, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing blood flow, primarily due to its vasodilatory and antithrombotic properties.</p>
<p>It reduces blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and improving endothelial function, largely due to its ability to modulate nitric oxide production and reduce vascular resistance.</p>
