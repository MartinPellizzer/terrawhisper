<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis liquorice acid is a triterpenoid compound that contributes to the herb's anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties by modulating immune responses and inhibiting viral replication.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis glycyrrhizin is a glycyrrhizinic acid derivative known for its potent antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, primarily due to its ability to inhibit the activity of enzymes like cyclooxygenase and phospholipase A2.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis saponins are a group of triterpene glycosides that exhibit expectorant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities by enhancing mucociliary clearance and suppressing inflammatory mediators.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis liquiritin is an isoflavone glycoside with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties, contributing to the herb's overall therapeutic profile by scavenging free radicals and modulating cellular signaling pathways.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of glycyrrhiza uralensis</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis root is the primary medicinal part of the licorice plant, known for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, which exhibits anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and expectorant properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory conditions, digestive issues, and skin ailments.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from this root include decoctions, tinctures, and powders, which are often incorporated into cough syrups, throat lozenges, and topical salves.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of glycyrrhiza uralensis</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis leads to hypertension because it contains glycyrrhizin, which inhibits the enzyme 11Î²-hydroxylase, leading to increased levels of aldosterone and subsequent sodium and water retention.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis leads to sodium retention because glycyrrhizin interferes with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, promoting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis causes fluid retention due to the same mechanism, as increased aldosterone levels lead to water retention in tissues.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhiza uralensis induces potassium loss because the increased aldosterone activity also enhances the excretion of potassium through the kidneys.</p>
