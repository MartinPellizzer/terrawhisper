<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Lippia alba can be used as a medicinal plant with potential benefits for digestive and respiratory conditions, but its safety profile requires careful consideration.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in moderate amounts, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, allergic reactions, or skin irritation in some individuals.  Lippia alba may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or blood pressure, and should be used cautiously with other herbs like St.  John's wort or ginkgo biloba.  It is not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to limited safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, it is advisable to start with small doses, monitor for adverse reactions, and consult a qualified herbalist or physician, especially for long-term or high-dose applications.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Lippia alba grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 6.</p>
<p>0 and 7. 5, and thrives in full sun to partial shade, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.  It is drought-tolerant but benefits from regular watering during the growing season, especially during dry periods, to promote vigorous growth and essential oil production.  For optimal care, regular pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth and prevents legginess, while mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  Harvesting should occur during the early morning or late afternoon when essential oils are most concentrated, using sharp scissors or shears to cut the flowering tops just above the leaves to preserve plant vigor.</p>
<p> To preserve potency, the harvested material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area or in a dehydrator at low temperatures, then stored in airtight glass jars in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain its therapeutic properties.</p>
