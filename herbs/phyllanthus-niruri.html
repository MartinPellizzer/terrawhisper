<p> Due to limited scientific evidence, it is recommended to use phyllanthus niruri sparingly, with a duration of no more than a few weeks unless guided by a healthcare professional.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Phyllanthus niruri can be used as a medicinal plant for its potential therapeutic properties, but it is important to be aware of its safety profile.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in recommended doses, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and allergic reactions in some individuals.  There is limited research on its interactions with other drugs or herbs, but caution is advised when combining it with medications that affect the liver or kidneys.  Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid phyllanthus niruri due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, it is recommended to follow proper dosage guidelines, consult with a qualified healthcare professional, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Phyllanthus niruri grows best in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 5.</p>
<p>5 and 7. 5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires moderate watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.  It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.  Regular weeding and pruning are essential to promote healthy growth, while mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  Harvesting is best done in the early morning or late afternoon when the plant is less stressed, using sharp scissors to cut the stems just above the base to ensure regrowth.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area to preserve its potency, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to extend shelf life.</p>
