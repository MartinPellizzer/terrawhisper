<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2><p>Pisum sativum has several health benefits, such as being a rich source of dietary fiber, protein, and essential nutrients like folate, iron, and magnesium.</p><p>It is known to support digestive health by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Additionally, the high antioxidant content in peas helps reduce inflammation and may lower the risk of chronic diseases.

Flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol are known for their ability to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. Alkaloids in peas, such as pisatine, have been shown to possess hypotensive and antispasmodic effects.</p><p>Additionally, saponins contribute to the plant's immune-modulating and cholesterol-lowering properties, further supporting its use in traditional and modern medicine.</p><h2 id="3">Preparations</h2><p>Pisum sativum has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and extracts, which are traditionally used to support digestive and cardiovascular health.</p><p>The seeds are often ground into powders or decocted into teas to aid in reducing inflammation and improving gut motility. Tinctures made from the dried seeds are believed to help lower cholesterol levels and support heart function. Additionally, some formulations use the plant's leaves and stems to create poultices for treating skin conditions and minor wounds.</p><p>While more research is needed, these traditional preparations highlight the potential of pisum sativum in holistic medicine.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Pisum sativum can have some side effects, such as digestive issues like bloating and gas due to its high fiber content.</p><p>In individuals with irritable bowel syndrome, consuming large amounts of peas may exacerbate symptoms. Some people may also experience allergic reactions, including itching, hives, or even more severe symptoms like anaphylaxis. Excessive consumption of peas may lead to an increase in flatulence because of the oligosaccharides they contain.</p><p>However, for most people, peas are generally safe and nutritious when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>
