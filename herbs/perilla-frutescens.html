<h2 id="1">Scientific and Botanical Profile</h2><p>Shiso, with botanical name Perilla frutescens, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family, commonly known as the mint family.</p><p>It is also referred to as Perilla, Chinese Basil, Japanese Mint, Chinese Mint, and is native to East Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, as well as parts of Southeast Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India. Morphologically, it is an upright annual herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually purple or green on the underside, and small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in whorled clusters.</p><p>The plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine across its native regions.</p><h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Shiso was used in ancient China and Japan as both a culinary herb and a medicinal plant, with references dating back over 2,000 years.</p><p>In traditional Chinese medicine, it was valued for its ability to aid digestion, reduce inflammation, and promote respiratory health, while in Japan, it has been an integral part of Shinto rituals and traditional cuisine for centuries. The plant holds cultural significance in Japan, where it is used in festivals, weddings, and as a symbol of purity and renewal, often incorporated into decorative arrangements and ceremonial offerings. Today, shiso is still used in traditional remedies, such as shiso tea to soothe sore throats or shiso leaves applied topically to reduce swelling and relieve muscle pain.</p><p>Its enduring presence in both medicine and culture highlights its deep-rooted importance across East Asian societies.</p><h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Shiso contains a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and terpenes, which contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties.</p><p>It is rich in vitamins such as A, C, and K, as well as minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium, making it a nutrient-dense leafy green. The presence of antioxidants like quercetin and rutin helps neutralize free radicals, supporting overall cellular health. Its essential oils, particularly perillaldehyde and limonene, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects by modulating immune responses and inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p>These compounds work synergistically to enhance digestion, reduce oxidative stress, and promote respiratory and digestive system health.</p><h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2><p>Perilla frutescens has been widely recognized for its diverse medicinal properties and health benefits, particularly in supporting the respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems.</p><p>It is known to alleviate symptoms of asthma and bronchitis by reducing inflammation and improving lung function, while also aiding digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and relieving bloating. Additionally, perilla frutescens contains compounds like rosmarinic acid and perillaldehyde, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol levels and improving blood flow. Compared to similar herbs like ginger or turmeric, perilla frutescens offers a more comprehensive approach to respiratory and digestive support, with its unique combination of volatile oils and flavonoids providing enhanced potency in reducing oxidative stress.</p><p>Its versatility in both culinary and medicinal applications makes it a valuable plant in traditional and modern health practices.</p><h2 id="5">Forms, Preparation and Usage</h2><p>Perilla frutescens has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its various therapeutic properties, and it is available in several forms including fresh leaves, dried tincture, powder, essential oil, and capsule.</p><p>It can be prepared as a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or as a decoction by boiling the plant material for a longer period. Topical applications include using the powder or essential oil for skin conditions, while the capsule form offers a convenient oral dosage. For adults, a typical dosage is 1 to 3 grams of dried leaves per day, while children should only use it under medical supervision if deemed safe.</p><p>It is recommended to use perilla frutescens sparingly, with a duration of no more than two weeks unless advised by a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Perilla frutescens can be used as a medicinal plant for its potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and digestive properties.</p><p>However, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, or allergic reactions in some individuals. It is important to note that perilla frutescens may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants and diabetes drugs, potentially altering their effectiveness. Special populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should avoid perilla frutescens due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p><p>To ensure safe use, it is recommended to start with small doses, monitor for adverse reactions, and consult with a qualified healthcare professional before incorporating it into a treatment regimen.</p><h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Perilla frutescens grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires regular watering to maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging.</p><p>It thrives in temperate climates and should be planted in early spring after the last frost, with spacing of about 30-45 cm between plants to allow for air circulation and growth. Regular weeding and mulching help control weeds and retain soil moisture, while pruning can encourage bushier growth and prevent legginess. Harvesting is best done when the leaves are young and tender, typically in late summer to early autumn, by cutting the stems just above a node to promote regrowth.</p><p>For storage, the leaves should be dried in a cool, dark place or frozen in airtight containers to preserve potency, while seeds can be stored in a cool, dry place in sealed jars to maintain their medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Perilla frutescens, a versatile medicinal plant known for its therapeutic properties, is commonly used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.</p><p>You can grow perilla frutescens at home in a sunny location with well-draining soil, making it a great choice for home gardens or indoor pots. The effects of perilla frutescens typically begin to show within a few weeks of regular consumption, though individual results may vary. It can be combined with other herbs like ginger or turmeric to enhance its benefits, but it's important to consult a healthcare provider before mixing supplements. While perilla frutescens is generally safe for short-term use, long-term safety should be discussed with a professional to avoid potential interactions or side effects.</p><p>The best way to consume perilla frutescens is through fresh leaves in salads, brewed as a tea, or taken as a supplement in capsule form.</p>
