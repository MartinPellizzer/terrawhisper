<h2 id="3">Side Effects of glycyrrhiza officinalis</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza officinalis causes fluid retention by increasing the body's retention of sodium and water, which can lead to edema, particularly in the lower extremities.</p>
<p>This sodium buildup can also contribute to hypertension, as the increased fluid volume in the bloodstream raises blood pressure levels. The herb may trigger arrhythmias due to its effects on electrolyte balance, particularly potassium levels, which are essential for normal heart function.</p>
<p>Additionally, the diuretic properties of glycyrrhiza can cause weakness and dizziness, especially if it leads to an imbalance in essential minerals. Some individuals may experience nausea or stomach pain as a result of the herb's impact on gastrointestinal function.</p>
<p>While glycyrrhiza officinalis is often used for its therapeutic benefits, these side effects highlight the importance of monitoring its use, particularly in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular or renal conditions.</p>

<p>The 9 most common side effects of Glycyrrhiza officinalis are shown in the image below.</p>
