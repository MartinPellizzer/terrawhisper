<p>It also causes stomach upset and digestive issues, as the herb can be harsh on the gastrointestinal tract, leading to discomfort and irregular digestion. The herb may lead to bloating and gas because it can slow down digestion and cause the buildup of intestinal gas.</p>
<p>Additionally, cola vera can trigger nausea and even diarrhea in some individuals, as it may stimulate bowel movements or irritate the intestines. It may also result in cramps and contribute to dehydration, as some people may experience increased urination or reduced fluid retention. Furthermore, the caffeine content in cola vera can cause insomnia and disrupt sleep patterns, making it unsuitable for individuals with sensitive digestive systems or sleep disorders.</p>
