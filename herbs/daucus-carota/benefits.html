<h2 id="0">1. Fights oxidative stress</h2>
<p>Oxidative stress is a condition characterized by an imbalance between free radicals and the body's ability to neutralize them, leading to cellular damage.</p>
<p>This health issue, also known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) overload or oxidative damage, arises when there is an excess of harmful molecules that can harm DNA, proteins, and lipids.</p>
<p>It is commonly experienced by individuals exposed to environmental pollutants, smokers, and those with poor dietary habits or chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>The daucus carota plant, or carrot, contains antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamin C, which help combat oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals and supporting the body's natural defenses.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/daucus-carota-benefits-fights-oxidative-stress.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with fights oxidative stress?</h2>
<p>Daucus carota fights oxidative stress because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
