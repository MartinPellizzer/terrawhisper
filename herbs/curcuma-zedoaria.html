<h2 id="4">Side Effects of curcuma zedoaria</h2>
<p>Curcuma zedoaria causes stomach upset due to its potent compounds that can irritate the gastrointestinal tract, leading to discomfort and bloating.</p>
<p>It may also cause indigestion by interfering with the normal digestive process, slowing down the movement of food through the stomach.

Additionally, it can lead to stomach pain and nausea, especially when consumed in high doses or on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>The herb also induces heartburn by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Furthermore, it may cause headaches due to its effect on blood vessels and could potentially trigger skin rashes in sensitive individuals. While it has blood-thinning properties, which can be beneficial for cardiovascular health, it also increases the risk of bleeding if not used cautiously.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating Curcuma zedoaria into oneâ€™s regimen, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions or on medication.</p>
