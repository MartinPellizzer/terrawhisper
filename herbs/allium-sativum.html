<h2 id="0">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Allium sativum seed, commonly known as garlic seed, refers to the small, hard, brown or white seeds found within the garlic bulb.</p>
<p>While the primary medicinal use of Allium sativum is associated with its bulbs, the seeds themselves contain bioactive compounds such as allicin, which contribute to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. These seeds are often used in traditional medicine to support digestive health and may help in reducing cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>However, the seeds are less commonly utilized compared to the bulb, as they contain lower concentrations of active compounds. The flower of Allium sativum, which appears as a small, white or pinkish cluster, is also used in some traditional remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The fruit, or capsule, of the plant contains essential oils and is sometimes used in herbal preparations to aid in respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
<p>Overall, while the seeds, flowers, and fruits of Allium sativum offer some medicinal benefits, the bulb remains the most extensively studied and utilized part of this herb.</p>

<h2 id="1">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Allium sativum teas are one of the most common and accessible ways to consume garlic, often prepared by steeping crushed garlic cloves in hot water.</p>
<p>These teas are valued for their potential to support immune function, reduce inflammation, and promote cardiovascular health. Garlic tea can be enhanced with other herbs like ginger or turmeric to amplify its therapeutic properties. However, it is important to note that raw garlic may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, so it is often recommended to use cooked or powdered garlic in teas.</p>
<p>In addition to teas, garlic can be prepared in various other forms, such as tinctures, capsules, and oils, each offering different benefits and methods of consumption. Tinctures, for example, provide a concentrated dose of garlicâ€™s active compounds, while oils are commonly used in topical applications for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Capsules offer a convenient and standardized way to take garlic, making them popular for daily supplementation. Oils and creams are frequently used in skincare and for treating minor infections or skin conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the versatility of Allium sativum allows for a wide range of herbal preparations that cater to different health needs and preferences.</p>

<h2 id="2">Side Effects of allium sativum</h2>
<p>Allium sativum causes stomach upset due to its strong compounds that can irritate the gastrointestinal tract, leading to discomfort and pain.</p>
<p>It may also lead to bad breath as a result of sulfur compounds released during digestion. The herb can cause digestive issues such as nausea and bloating, as it may slow down the digestive process in some individuals.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can trigger heartburn and gas, as it relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing stomach acid to flow back up. Allium sativum may result in diarrhea in sensitive individuals, and in rare cases, it can cause allergic reactions, including skin rashes or respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>While it is widely used for its health benefits, these side effects highlight the importance of moderation and consulting a healthcare professional before incorporating it into one's diet, especially for those with existing digestive conditions or allergies.</p>
