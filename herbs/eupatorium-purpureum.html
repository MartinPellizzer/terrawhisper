Harvesting should occur during the late summer to early autumn when the flowers are in full bloom, using sharp scissors or shears to cut the stems just above the leaves to preserve the plant's vigor.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the plant material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area to prevent mold, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve its potency and medicinal properties.</p>
