<h2 id="0">1. Heals skin infections</h2>
<p>Skin Infections.</p>
<p>A condition characterized by bacterial, fungal, or viral contamination of the skin, leading to redness, swelling, and sometimes pus.</p>
<p>This issue often arises from breaks in the skin's barrier, such as cuts, abrasions, or insect bites, and can be exacerbated by poor hygiene or a weakened immune system.</p>
<p>Individuals who frequently engage in activities that cause skin trauma, such as athletes or manual laborers, are more prone to experiencing these infections.</p>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris, commonly known as Lady's Mantle, has been traditionally used for its healing properties, which can aid in the recovery and prevention of such skin conditions.</p>

<h3>How this herb helps with heals skin infections?</h2>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris heals skin infections because it contains bioactive constituents such as flavonoids and alkaloids.</p>
<p>These compounds exhibit antimicrobial properties that help combat bacterial and fungal pathogens. The flavonoids in the plant possess anti-inflammatory effects, reducing redness and swelling associated with infections. Alkaloids contribute to the plant's ability to promote wound healing and tissue regeneration.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents make Alchemilla vulgaris a valuable natural remedy for treating various skin conditions.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", Alchemilla vulgaris has been shown to promote wound healing by accelerating re-epithelialization, collagen synthesis, and the regeneration of skin appendages, and by improving angiogenesis, the stabilization of blood vessels, and the formation of granulation tissue, indicating its potential to heal skin infections in a positive way.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Treats wounds faster</h2>
<p>Wound healing.</p>
<p>Chronic wound healing refers to the process by which damaged tissues repair themselves, often taking longer than normal.</p>
<p>This condition can be caused by factors such as poor circulation, diabetes, or infections, and is commonly experienced by individuals with diabetes, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris, also known as lady’s mantle, is believed to promote faster wound healing due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Its use in traditional medicine suggests it may support the body’s natural repair mechanisms and reduce the risk of complications.</p>
