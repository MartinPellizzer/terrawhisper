<p> The plant has a long history in traditional European and Asian medicine, where it was often employed to alleviate symptoms of fever, coughs, and inflammation.  In medieval times, it was also associated with fertility and was used in rituals to promote conception, while in some folklore traditions, it was believed to ward off evil spirits.

<p> To prepare lamium album, it can be made into a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or a decoction can be made by boiling the dried plant material for a longer period.  For topical use, a poultice or infused oil can be applied directly to the skin for conditions like inflammation or minor wounds.  The recommended dosage for adults is typically 1-2 cups of tea per day, while for children, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p>
<p> Usage should be conservative, with a duration of no more than two weeks unless under medical supervision.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Lamium album can be used cautiously as a medicinal plant, though its safety profile is not well-established in clinical studies.</p>
<p> It is generally considered safe for short-term use in moderate amounts, but potential side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and skin irritation.  There is limited information on drug or herb interactions, but caution is advised when combining lamium album with other herbs or medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or blood pressure.  Special populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should avoid lamium album due to insufficient evidence on its safety during these periods, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
<p> For safe use, it is recommended to start with small doses, monitor for adverse effects, and consult with a qualified healthcare professional before incorporating lamium album into any treatment regimen.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Lamium album grows best in moist, well-drained soil in partial to full shade, thriving in temperate climates with cool temperatures.</p>
<p> It prefers a slightly acidic to neutral pH and requires regular watering to maintain consistent moisture without becoming waterlogged.  To ensure healthy growth, mulching around the base of the plant helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds, while pruning back spent flowers encourages further blooming.  The best time to harvest lamium album is in late spring to early summer when the leaves are fully developed and the plant is at its most potent.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the leaves should be dried in a cool, dark place with good air circulation to preserve their medicinal properties, and stored in airtight containers to maintain potency and prevent moisture damage.</p>
