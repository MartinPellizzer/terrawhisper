The plant is typically harvested during the flowering stage, which occurs in late summer to early autumn, by cutting the stems just above the base with sharp shears to encourage regrowth.</p>
<p> For maximum potency, the harvested material should be dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place, or refrigerated to preserve its medicinal properties.</p>
