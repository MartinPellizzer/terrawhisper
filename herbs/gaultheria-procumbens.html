The plant's leaves contain methyl salicylate, which is responsible for its pain-relieving properties and is commonly used in topical applications. In addition to tinctures, the leaves can be brewed into a tea to help alleviate symptoms of arthritis and muscle pain.</p><p>These preparations have been utilized for centuries by indigenous communities and are now widely recognized in herbal medicine for their natural healing benefits.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Gaultheria procumbens can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large amounts.</p><p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Ericaceae family, leading to skin rashes or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use or high doses might interfere with certain medications, particularly those affecting the liver or kidneys. In rare cases, it has been associated with toxicity, though such instances are uncommon when used as directed.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using gaultheria procumbens, especially for prolonged periods or in combination with other treatments.</p>
