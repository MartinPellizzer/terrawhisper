In rural communities across Asia, Cow Knee has also played a role in folk rituals, where it is sometimes burned as an offering to appease ancestral spirits or to ward off negative energies.

The plant is typically harvested in the autumn when the roots are most potent, using a spade or fork to carefully dig up the entire root system without damaging the roots. After harvesting, the roots should be washed, sliced, and dried in a cool, dark, well-ventilated area to preserve their medicinal properties, and stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to extend shelf life.</p><p>Proper care and timely harvesting ensure the retention of the plant's active compounds, making it valuable for traditional and modern medicinal uses.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Achyranthes bidentata, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p><p>Can I grow achyranthes bidentata at home?
