<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera epicatechin is a powerful antioxidant found in red wine and grapes, known for its ability to improve cardiovascular health by promoting the production of nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels.</p>
<p>Alongside epicatechin, resveratrol, another key compound in Vitis vinifera, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, as well as its potential to extend lifespan by activating sirtuins, a family of proteins involved in cellular health. Anthocyanins, responsible for the deep red and purple hues of grapes, contribute to the herbâ€™s antioxidant profile and have been linked to improved vision, reduced oxidative stress, and enhanced cognitive function. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in Vitis vinifera, exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting immune function and potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>Together, these medicinal constituents make Vitis vinifera a valuable source of natural compounds that support overall health and well-being.</p>
