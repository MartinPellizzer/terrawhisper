<h2 id="1">Scientific and Botanical Profile</h2><p>Cork Tree, with botanical name Phellodendron amurense, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is commonly known by various names including Amur Corktree, Amur Cork Tree, Amur Mahogany, and Yellow Barked Tree.</p><p>Native to regions such as China, Korea, Japan, and Siberia, it also extends through Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe. Morphologically, it is a deciduous tree with a tall, straight trunk and smooth, often yellowish-barked trunk, which gives it the common name Yellow Barked Tree. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin, while its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles.</p><p>The tree is also known as Yellow Poplar, Yellow Buckeye, and Yellow Birch in some regions, though these names are often used for other species, and it is sometimes referred to as Yellow Mulberry or Phellodendron Tree due to its botanical classification and appearance.</p><h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Cork Tree was used for centuries in traditional medicine systems across Asia, particularly in China, where it has been valued for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.</p><p>The bark and roots of the plant were traditionally prepared into decoctions and pastes to treat ailments such as fever, skin infections, and digestive disorders. In Chinese herbal medicine, it is often combined with other herbs to enhance its therapeutic effects, reflecting its deep integration into holistic healing practices. Culturally, the Cork Tree has been associated with longevity and vitality, and in some regions, it was used in rituals to ward off evil spirits or promote health during seasonal changes.</p><p>Today, its extracts are still used in modern herbal supplements and pharmaceuticals, demonstrating the enduring relevance of this ancient plant in both traditional and contemporary medicine.</p><h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Cork Tree contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids such as berberine, flavonoids like phellodine and phelloneurin, and essential oils rich in terpenes, which contribute to its therapeutic properties.</p><p>It is also a good source of nutrients, including vitamins B complex, vitamin C, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, along with antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress. These compounds work synergistically in the body by modulating inflammatory pathways, enhancing gut health, and supporting detoxification processes. The alkaloid berberine, in particular, is known for its antimicrobial and antidiabetic effects by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing glucose absorption.</p><p>Overall, the chemical composition and nutritional profile of Cork Tree make it a valuable herbal remedy with multiple health benefits.</p><h2 id="4">Medicinal Properties and Health Benefits</h2><p>Phellodendron amurense has been widely recognized for its potent medicinal properties, particularly its ability to support liver health by promoting detoxification and reducing inflammation.</p><p>It is also known to enhance kidney function by helping to regulate fluid balance and eliminate toxins from the body. Additionally, this plant exhibits antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, making it beneficial for the digestive and respiratory systems. Compared to similar herbs like berberis and goldenseal, phellodendron amurense offers a broader spectrum of therapeutic actions with greater potency in liver and kidney support, while also demonstrating unique neuroprotective properties that set it apart.</p><p>Its versatile applications make it a valuable herb in traditional and modern herbal medicine.</p><h2 id="5">Forms, Preparation and Usage</h2><p>Phellodendron amurense has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its therapeutic properties, and it is available in various forms including fresh bark, dried bark, tincture, powder, essential oil, and capsule.</p><p>The preparation methods vary, with tea and decoction being common for internal use, while infusion and topical application are used for skin conditions. For adults, a typical dosage is 300-600 mg of standardized extract in capsule form, taken two to three times daily, while children should only use it under medical supervision. It is recommended to use phellodendron amurense for short durations, typically no longer than two weeks, to avoid potential side effects.</p><p>Due to its potency, conservative use and professional guidance are advised, especially for prolonged or repeated applications.</p><h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Phellodendron amurense can be used as a medicinal plant for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antidiabetic properties, but its use requires careful consideration due to potential safety concerns.</p><p>While generally considered safe when used in moderate doses, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and skin irritation in some individuals. It is important to note that phellodendron amurense may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants and diabetes treatments, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. Special populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should avoid its use due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p><p>To ensure safe use, always follow recommended dosages, consult with a healthcare professional, and discontinue use if any adverse reactions occur.</p><h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Phellodendron amurense grows best in well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, in full sun to partial shade, and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging.</p><p>It thrives in temperate climates and benefits from regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. To ensure optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and mulch around the base to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds. Harvesting is best done in late summer to early autumn when the bark is mature and contains the highest concentration of active compounds; the bark is carefully stripped from the trunk using a sharp knife or hand tool.</p><p>For storage, the harvested bark should be thoroughly dried in a well-ventilated area or in a dehydrator at low heat to prevent mold, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dry place or refrigerated to preserve its potency and medicinal properties.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Phellodendron amurense, also known as Amur cork tree, is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>It can be grown at home in temperate climates, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade, though it may require a large space due to its size. The effects of phellodendron amurense typically begin to show within a few weeks of consistent use, though results may vary depending on the individual and the condition being treated. It can be combined with other herbs, but it is important to consult a healthcare professional to avoid potential interactions.</p><p>While short-term use is generally safe, long-term consumption should be monitored due to the risk of toxicity, and the best way to consume it is through standardized extracts or tinctures under professional guidance.</p>
