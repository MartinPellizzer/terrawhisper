<p> Native to Central Europe, Southeast Europe, the Balkans, Southwest Asia, Southern Italy, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Carpathian Basin, the Danube Basin, and Northern Africa, it is widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and medicinal properties.  Morphologically, it features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive cordate base, small white flowers that bloom in early summer, and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age.  The tree typically grows to a height of 15-25 meters, with a rounded crown and shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p> Commonly referred to as Tilia, European Lime, Lime Tree, Tilia Tree, Littleleaf Lime, and Small-Leaf Linden, it has been valued for centuries in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
<h2 id="2">History and Cultural Relevance</h2><p>Small-Leaf Lime was used by ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans for its medicinal and aesthetic properties, often planted in gardens and public spaces for its fragrant blossoms and shade.</p>
<p> In traditional European herbal medicine, its leaves and flowers were valued for their ability to treat ailments like coughs, respiratory issues, and skin conditions, with the bark also used to make tea for digestive health.  The tree held cultural significance in various folk traditions, where it was believed to bring prosperity and was often planted near homes or churches to ward off evil spirits.  In some regions, its flowers were incorporated into spring festivals and weddings, symbolizing renewal and purity.</p>
<p> Today, its essential oils are still used in aromatherapy and herbal remedies, reflecting its enduring relevance in both traditional and modern wellness practices.</p>
<h2 id="3">Chemical Composition and Nutritional Profile</h2><p>Small-Leaf Lime contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids such as quercetin and kaempferol, which are known for their antioxidant properties.</p>
<p> It also contains essential oils rich in terpenes like limonene and pinene, contributing to its aromatic profile and potential therapeutic effects.  Nutritional-wise, the plant is a good source of vitamins C and E, along with minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which support immune function and cellular health.

<p>Discover the <a href="/herbs/tilia-cordata/benefits.html">10 best health benefits of Small-Leaf Lime</a>.</p><h2 id="5">Forms, Preparation and Usage</h2><p>Tilia cordata has been traditionally used for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, with various forms available including fresh leaves, dried tincture, powder, essential oil, and capsule.</p>
<p> To prepare, it can be made into a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or a decoction by boiling the leaves for a longer time.  Topical applications involve using a diluted essential oil or a powdered form mixed with a carrier oil.  The recommended dosage for adults is typically 1-2 cups of tea per day, while children may use a reduced dose if deemed safe by a healthcare provider.</p>
<p> Usage should be conservative, with a duration of up to two weeks for acute conditions, and longer-term use should be monitored by a professional.</p>
<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Tilia cordata can be used as a medicinal plant for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, but it is important to consider its safety profile.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in moderate amounts, it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, drowsiness, or allergic reactions in some individuals.  Tilia cordata may interact with medications such as sedatives, antidepressants, or anticoagulants, potentially increasing their effects or causing adverse reactions.  It is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient safety data, and caution is advised for individuals with chronic illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, consult a healthcare provider before taking tilia cordata, follow recommended dosages, and discontinue use if any adverse effects occur.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Tilia cordata grows best in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter, with a slightly acidic to neutral pH.</p>
<p> It thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings, and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.  Regular pruning is recommended to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth, while mulching around the base of the plant helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.  The best time to harvest Tilia cordata is in early summer when the flowers are fully open, and the flowers should be carefully picked by hand or with small shears to avoid damaging the plant.</p>
<p> To preserve its medicinal potency, the harvested flowers should be dried in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area, then stored in airtight containers away from light and moisture, ideally in a refrigerator to extend their shelf life.</p>
