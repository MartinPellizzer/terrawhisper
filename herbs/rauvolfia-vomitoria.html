<h2 id="4">Side Effects of rauvolfia vomitoria</h2>
<p>Rauvolfia vomitoria induces vomiting due to its high concentration of alkaloids, which stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, triggering the vomiting reflex.</p>
<p>Rauvolfia vomitoria leads to nausea as the same alkaloids can irritate the gastrointestinal tract and activate the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. Rauvolfia vomitoria causes low blood pressure because its alkaloids, particularly reserpine, deplete neurotransmitters that regulate vascular tone, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure.</p>
<p>Rauvolfia vomitoria leads to sleepiness as the alkaloids may affect the central nervous system, promoting sedation and reducing alertness.</p>
