<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts of citrus aurantium</h2>
<p>Citrus aurantium fruit is primarily used for its peel, which contains volatile oils and flavonoids, making it valuable in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The fruit's essential oil, extracted through cold pressing, is commonly used in aromatherapy and as a digestive aid.</p>
<p>The flower of Citrus aurantium is also utilized, particularly in the form of a tincture or infusion, to support cardiovascular health and reduce stress.</p>
<p>The leaf and seed, though less commonly used, can be prepared into decoctions or infusions to aid in digestion and respiratory support.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of citrus aurantium</h2>
<p>Citrus aurantium teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried flower buds in hot water, and they are often used for their purported ability to support mood and digestion, though their efficacy remains debated.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium tinctures, which are alcohol-based extracts, are frequently used for their potential to enhance circulation and reduce stress, though they may cause side effects like heart palpitations if not used carefully.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium capsules provide a convenient and standardized form of the herb, making them popular for their ease of use and consistent dosing, though they may not be as effective as other preparation methods.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium decoctions, involving boiling the herb for an extended period, are believed to extract more potent compounds, but they can be harsh and may require careful preparation to avoid toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of citrus aurantium</h2>
<p>Citrus aurantium anxiety occurs frequently because it contains high levels of synephrine, a compound that can stimulate the central nervous system and increase adrenaline levels, leading to heightened alertness and stress.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium heart palpitations occur due to the stimulant effects of synephrine, which can increase heart rate and blood pressure by activating the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium insomnia occurs often because the stimulating properties of the herb can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making it difficult to fall or stay asleep.</p>
<p>Citrus aurantium dizziness occurs as a result of its cardiovascular effects, which can cause fluctuations in blood pressure and reduced blood flow to the brain.</p>
