<p>Together, these compounds make Scutellaria lateriflora a valuable herb for promoting mental clarity and focus.</p>

<h2 id="9">10. Reduces inflammation markers</h2>
<p>Chronic inflammation is a persistent, low-level inflammatory response that can lead to tissue damage and various diseases.</p>
<p>This condition, also known as systemic inflammation or prolonged inflammatory activity, occurs when the body's immune system remains activated over an extended period.</p>
<p>It is often caused by factors such as poor diet, chronic stress, environmental toxins, or underlying health conditions like obesity or autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>Individuals with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or metabolic syndrome are commonly affected.</p>
<p>Scutellaria lateriflora, also known as blue flag iris, has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation markers, offering a natural approach to managing this ongoing health challenge.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/scutellaria-lateriflora-benefits-reduces-inflammation-markers.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with reduces inflammation markers?</h2>
<p>Scutellaria lateriflora reduces inflammation markers because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds have been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory pathways in the body. Alkaloids like baicalin and flavonoids such as wogonin exhibit strong anti-inflammatory properties. They help modulate cytokine production and reduce oxidative stress.</p>
