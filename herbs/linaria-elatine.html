                <h1>Linaria Elatine</h1><p>Linaria elatine, commonly known as common toadflax, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, particularly in the treatment of respiratory and skin conditions.</p><p>The plant contains bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and iridoids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. In folk medicine, it has been employed to alleviate symptoms of coughs, asthma, and skin irritations due to its soothing properties. Modern research suggests that Linaria elatine may also possess antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, supporting its traditional use.</p><p>However, further scientific studies are needed to fully explore its potential therapeutic applications and ensure safe usage.</p>
