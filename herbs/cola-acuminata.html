<p>Cognitive functions may be impaired, leading to a brain feeling foggy, as the herb affects neurotransmitter activity and may disrupt normal mental clarity. Additionally, Cola acuminata can lead to muscle weakness and bone fragility due to its impact on calcium metabolism and muscle function, while oral health issues such as gum swelling, tooth sensitivity, and mouth sores may develop from its acidic and irritant properties.</p>
<p>These side effects highlight the potential risks associated with the use of this herb, particularly when consumed in large quantities or over extended periods.</p>
