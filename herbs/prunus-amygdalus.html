<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Prunus amygdalus amygdalin, also known as laetrile, is a glycoside found in the seeds of the bitter almond, and it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Although amygdalin is often associated with alternative cancer treatments, its efficacy remains controversial due to the risk of cyanide toxicity when metabolized in the body. In addition to amygdalin, Prunus amygdalus contains gallic acid, a polyphenolic compound with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which may contribute to its therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>β-sitosterol, another constituent, is a plant sterol that has been shown to support cardiovascular health and may help reduce cholesterol levels. Prunasin, a cyanogenic glycoside, is related to amygdalin and may play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms, though its medicinal applications are less well-documented compared to other compounds. These constituents collectively highlight the complex biochemical profile of Prunus amygdalus, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for various health conditions.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand their pharmacological effects and ensure safe usage.</p>
