<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum relieves depression symptoms by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which are known to regulate mood and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation markers by containing bioactive compounds like hyperforin and flavonoids, which inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulate the immune response. It reduces oxidative stress by acting as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and preventing cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species. It reduces anxiety levels by influencing the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and modulating the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is involved in stress response.</p>
<p>It increases melatonin production by enhancing the activity of enzymes involved in melatonin synthesis, promoting better sleep quality and regulating circadian rhythms.</p>
