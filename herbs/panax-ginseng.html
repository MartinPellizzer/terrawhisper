<p>Panax ginseng triterpenoids, which include compounds like dammarane-type derivatives, play a role in regulating cellular functions, reducing inflammation, and promoting overall metabolic health through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.</p>
<p>Panax ginseng saponins, a class of compounds that includes ginsenosides, are known for their ability to improve energy metabolism, enhance physical endurance, and support cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of panax ginseng</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng root is the primary medicinal part of the ginseng plant, known for its potent adaptogenic and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>It contains bioactive compounds such as ginsenosides, which are responsible for its various health benefits.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from the root include ginseng tea, tinctures, extracts, and powders, each offering different methods of consumption and absorption.</p>
<p>These preparations are commonly used to enhance energy, support cognitive function, and promote overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of panax ginseng</h2>
