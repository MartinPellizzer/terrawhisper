Tinctures are created by soaking the root in alcohol or glycerin, which extracts and concentrates the active ingredients for potent use. Capsules and powders offer convenient oral administration, making it easier to incorporate ginseng into daily routines.</p><p>These preparations are widely used to support energy, cognitive function, and immune health, though their efficacy can vary depending on the form and preparation method.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Panax ginseng can have some side effects, such as insomnia, headaches, and digestive issues in some individuals.</p><p>It may also cause anxiety, restlessness, or irritability, particularly at higher doses. Long-term use could potentially lead to hormonal imbalances, affecting thyroid or adrenal function.
