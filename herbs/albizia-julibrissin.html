The plant is typically harvested in late summer to early fall when the pods turn brown and begin to split, using clean shears to cut the pods just below the base for optimal yield.</p><p>For storage, the harvested pods should be thoroughly dried in a well-ventilated area to prevent mold, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place to preserve potency and extend shelf life.</p><h2 id="8">FAQ</h2><p>Albizia julibrissin, also known as the Chinese silk tree, is a medicinal plant commonly used for its calming and mood-enhancing properties.</p><p>It is generally safe to grow at home in warm climates, as it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, though it may require some care to prevent it from becoming invasive.
