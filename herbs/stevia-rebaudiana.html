<p>Stevia rebaudiana is considered a natural sweetener and has been used for centuries for its hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It can be prepared as an infusion, tincture, or powder, making it versatile for use in teas, cooking, and herbal remedies.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana treats diabetes naturally because it contains compounds called steviol glycosides that do not affect blood sugar levels and may even improve insulin sensitivity, helping regulate glucose metabolism without causing spikes.</p>
<p>It reduces sugar intake because it is a zero-calorie sweetener that satisfies the sweet tooth without the negative effects of sugar, making it a healthier alternative for those looking to cut back on added sugars. It reduces inflammation due to its rich content of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, which help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress in the body. It supports heart health by improving lipid profiles, lowering bad cholesterol (LDL), and increasing good cholesterol (HDL), which reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>It lowers blood pressure by acting as a natural diuretic and by improving vascular function, which helps relax blood vessels and reduce the strain on the cardiovascular system.</p>
