<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts of stevia rebaudiana</h2>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana leaf is the primary medicinal part of the plant, known for its intense sweetness and various health benefits.</p>
<p>The leaves contain steviol glycosides, which are responsible for the plant's sweetening properties and potential therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>The main herbal preparations made from the leaves include stevia extract, which is commonly used as a natural sweetener, and herbal teas made by steeping the dried leaves in hot water.</p>
<p>Additionally, the leaves can be used to make tinctures or powdered supplements for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of stevia rebaudiana</h2>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana teas are commonly prepared by steeping dried leaves or stems in hot water, often used for their mild, sweet flavor and potential health benefits, though they are not as potent as the extracted stevia glycosides found in other preparations.</p>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana capsules are a popular form of consumption, containing concentrated extracts of the herb, typically standardized to contain specific levels of stevioside and rebaudioside A, making them a common choice for those seeking a natural sweetener without calories.</p>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana decoctions involve boiling the leaves or roots for a longer period, which can enhance the extraction of active compounds, though this method is less common due to the potential for bitterness and reduced sweetness.</p>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana tinctures are alcohol-based extracts that concentrate the herb's active components, offering a potent and convenient form for use in cooking or as a dietary supplement.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects of stevia rebaudiana</h2>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana causes oral irritation due to the presence of its bitter compounds, which can stimulate the taste buds and mucous membranes in the mouth.</p>
<p>It triggers nausea because the herb's active compounds may affect the digestive system and send signals to the brain that can induce vomiting.</p>
<p>Stevia rebaudiana causes dry mouth as it has a diuretic effect and can reduce saliva production, leading to a decrease in moisture in the mouth.</p>
<p>It causes throat irritation because the same bitter compounds that cause oral irritation can also irritate the throat lining when swallowed.</p>
