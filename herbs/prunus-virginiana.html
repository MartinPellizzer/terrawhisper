<p>It reduces fever quickly because it contains compounds that act as natural antipyretics, helping to regulate body temperature by promoting sweating and reducing the production of fever-inducing substances like prostaglandins. It reduces anxiety attacks by interacting with the central nervous system to modulate neurotransmitter activity, particularly increasing levels of GABA, which has a calming effect on the brain. It eases anxiety symptoms by containing adaptogens that help the body manage stress and balance the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to a reduction in stress hormone levels.</p>
<p>It lowers blood pressure by improving vascular function and reducing arterial stiffness, thanks to its antioxidant properties that help relax blood vessels and enhance blood flow.</p>
