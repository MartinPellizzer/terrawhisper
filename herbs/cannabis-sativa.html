Medical cannabis is commonly used to treat conditions like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It also shows promise in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting and reducing muscle spasms in patients with neurological disorders.</p><p>As research continues, the therapeutic applications of Cannabis sativa are expanding, offering new possibilities for patient care under regulated medical frameworks.</p><h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>Cannabis sativa has several health benefits, such as its potential to alleviate chronic pain and reduce inflammation.</p><p>It contains compounds like CBD and THC, which have been studied for their ability to manage conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis.
