<h2 id="2">Side Effects of cannabis sativa</h2>
<p>Cannabis sativa eyes red become due to the dilation of blood vessels in the conjunctiva, which is caused by the herb's active compound, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), affecting the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Cannabis sativa heart rate elevates because THC stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in cardiac output and heart rate.</p>
<p>Cannabis sativa appetite increases as THC interacts with cannabinoid receptors in the brain's reward system, particularly the endocannabinoid system, which regulates hunger.</p>
<p>Cannabis sativa coordination impairs because THC affects the cerebellum and other brain regions responsible for motor control, leading to delayed reflexes and impaired balance.</p>

<p>The 9 most common side effects of Cannabis sativa are shown in the image below.</p>
