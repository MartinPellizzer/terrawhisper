<h2 id="5">6. Soothes menstrual cramps</h2>
<p>Menstrual cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, are painful contractions of the uterus that occur during menstruation.</p>
<p>These cramps are often described as sharp or throbbing pains in the lower abdomen and can radiate to the back or thighs.</p>
<p>They are typically caused by the release of prostaglandins, which trigger uterine contractions to expel the menstrual lining.</p>
<p>Women of reproductive age, especially those with heavy or irregular periods, are most commonly affected.</p>
<p>Chamaelirium luteum, a native North American plant, has been traditionally used to soothe these cramps by reducing inflammation and easing uterine tension.</p>
