<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Moringa oleifera can be considered generally safe when consumed in moderate amounts as part of a balanced diet, but it may cause side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, or allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>

The leaves and pods are typically harvested 60 to 90 days after planting, with the best time being when the leaves are young and tender, using clean scissors to cut them from the plant.</p>
<p> To preserve potency, harvested parts should be dried in a well-ventilated area or in a dehydrator at low temperatures, then stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to maintain their nutritional and medicinal properties.</p>
