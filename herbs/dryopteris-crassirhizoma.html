<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Dryopteris crassirhizoma can be used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties, but its safety profile requires careful consideration.</p>
<p> While some studies suggest it may have therapeutic benefits, there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy, and its use should be approached with caution.  Potential side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, allergic reactions, and possible liver toxicity, particularly with long-term or high-dose usage.  It may interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants and antidiabetic drugs, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.  Special populations, including pregnant or breastfeeding women and individuals with chronic illnesses, should avoid its use due to insufficient safety data, and it is generally not recommended for use during pregnancy or lactation.</p>
<p> To ensure safe use, consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting any regimen involving dryopteris crassirhizoma, and follow recommended dosages to minimize risks.</p>
<h2 id="7">Growing, Harvesting and Storage</h2><p>Dryopteris crassirhizoma grows in moist, shaded environments with well-draining, loamy soil rich in organic matter, thriving in partial to full shade and requiring consistent moisture without waterlogging.</p>
<p> It prefers cool to temperate climates and benefits from mulching to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.  Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods, while avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot.  To maintain healthy growth, it should be pruned to remove dead fronds and fertilized lightly in early spring with a balanced organic fertilizer.  Harvesting is best done in late spring to early summer when the fronds are fully developed but before they begin to yellow; the rhizomes are carefully dug out using a spade, ensuring minimal damage to the plant.  For preservation, the harvested rhizomes should be washed, cut into small pieces, and dried in a shaded, well-ventilated area or using a dehydrator to prevent mold.</p>
<p> Once fully dried, they should be stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark, and dry place, or refrigerated to maintain potency and extend shelf life.</p>
