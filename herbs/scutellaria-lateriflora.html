                <h1>Scutellaria Lateriflora</h1><p>Scutellaria lateriflora, commonly known as blue cohosh, is a perennial herb native to North America and has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties.</p><p>It contains various bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and flavonoids, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Historically, it has been employed to support women's health, particularly in缓解 menstrual cramps and as a remedy for menopausal symptoms. However, due to its potential toxicity, especially when used in high doses or over prolonged periods, its use is cautioned and regulated in many regions.</p><p>Despite these concerns, it remains a subject of ongoing research for its possible applications in treating inflammation and neurological conditions.</p>
