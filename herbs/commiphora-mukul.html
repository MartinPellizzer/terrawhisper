<p>Commiphora mukul heal arthritis pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce swelling and stiffness in joints by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>This herb protects heart health by lowering cholesterol levels and improving blood lipid profiles, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul enhances immune system function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and modulating immune responses to fight infections more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="1">Medicinal Constituents of commiphora mukul</h2>
<p>Commiphora mukul triterpenoids, particularly boswellic acids, are the primary bioactive compounds responsible for the herb's anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, with compounds like acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) exhibiting potent inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in inflammatory pathways.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul glycosides, such as acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid glucoside, contribute to the herb's therapeutic effects by enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of the triterpenoids while also displaying mild anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul sterols, including cycloartenol and other phytosterols, play a role in modulating cell membrane fluidity and may support the herb's anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects by influencing lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul polyphenols, although less abundant than triterpenoids, contribute to its antioxidant capacity by scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress, thereby supporting overall cellular health and inflammatory response regulation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Medicinal Parts of commiphora mukul</h2>
<p>Commiphora mukul root is commonly used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties, primarily due to its high content of guggulsterones, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects.</p>
<p>The root is typically dried and ground into a powder, which can be used to prepare decoctions or pastes for topical application or oral consumption.</p>
<p>The stem of Commiphora mukul is also utilized, often similarly to the root, by grinding it into a powder or using it in the preparation of oils and tinctures.</p>
<p>The leaves, although less commonly used than the root and stem, can be dried and infused into herbal teas or used in poultices for their mild soothing and healing properties.</p>

<h2 id="3">Herbal Preparations of commiphora mukul</h2>
<p>Commiphora mukul teas are widely used for their calming and digestive benefits, typically prepared by steeping the dried resin or powdered bark in hot water, and are commonly consumed to alleviate stress, improve digestion, and support respiratory health.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul decoctions, which involve simmering the herb for an extended period, are often preferred for their stronger potency and are used to address more severe conditions such as digestive disorders and inflammatory ailments.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul tinctures, made by soaking the herb in alcohol or glycerin, offer a concentrated form of the herb and are frequently used for their ability to support adrenal function and reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul capsules provide a convenient and standardized dosage form, making them popular for daily use in managing stress, enhancing mood, and supporting overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects of commiphora mukul</h2>
<p>Commiphora mukul induces drowsiness because it contains compounds that act as mild sedatives, affecting the central nervous system and promoting relaxation.</p>
<p>It causes stomach upset due to its potential to irritate the gastrointestinal tract and slow down digestion.</p>
<p>Commiphora mukul results in dry mouth as it may reduce saliva production, possibly due to its anticholinergic properties.</p>
<p>It leads to nausea because it can affect the digestive system and stimulate the vomiting center in the brain.</p>
