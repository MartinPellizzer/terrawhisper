<p>0 and 7. 5, thriving in full sun to partial shade and requiring minimal water once established.  It is drought-tolerant and prefers warm, arid climates, making it suitable for regions with hot summers and mild winters.

Harvesting is best done in late summer to early fall when the roots are most mature, using a spade or shovel to carefully excavate the tubers without damaging them.</p>
<p> For optimal potency, the harvested roots should be thoroughly washed, sliced, and dried in a cool, shaded area before being stored in airtight containers in a cool, dark place or refrigerated to preserve their medicinal properties.</p>
