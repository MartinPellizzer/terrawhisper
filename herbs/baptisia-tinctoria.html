It treats cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inhibiting the growth of cancerous cells through the modulation of various signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. It treats skin conditions by promoting wound healing, reducing redness, and combating microbial infections due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It supports the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing the body's ability to fight off infections and diseases.</p>
