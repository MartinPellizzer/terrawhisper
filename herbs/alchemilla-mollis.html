<p> It can be prepared as a tea by steeping dried leaves in hot water, or as a decoction by boiling the plant material for a longer period, while an infusion involves soaking the plant in cold or room temperature water.

<h2 id="6">Safety, Side Effects and Contraindications</h2><p>Alchemilla mollis can be used as a medicinal plant with potential benefits for skin conditions and digestive health, but its safety profile requires careful consideration.</p>
<p> While generally considered safe when used in moderate amounts, it may cause mild side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, nausea, or allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.  There is limited research on drug or herb interactions, but caution is advised when combining it with anticoagulants or other herbs that affect blood clotting.  Special populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should avoid alchemilla mollis due to insufficient safety data, and individuals with chronic illnesses should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>

<p> It thrives in temperate climates and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established.  To ensure healthy growth, mulching around the base of the plant helps retain moisture and suppress weeds, while occasional pruning encourages dense foliage and prevents legginess.  Harvesting should occur in late spring to early summer when the leaves are young and most potent, using clean shears to cut the top 6 to 8 inches of the plant.</p>
<p> After harvesting, the leaves should be dried in a cool, shaded area with good airflow, then stored in airtight containers away from light and moisture to preserve their medicinal potency.</p>
