<h2 id="3">4. Acts as antiseptic</h2>
<p>Antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial action.</p>
<p>The ability to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The health issue mentioned is infection, which refers to the invasion of the body by harmful microorganisms.</p>
<p>Infection can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites and is commonly experienced by individuals with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, children, or those with chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Herniaria glabra plant acts as an antiseptic by inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms, thereby supporting the body's natural defenses against infection.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/herniaria-glabra-benefits-acts-as-antiseptic.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with acts as antiseptic?</h2>
<p>Herniaria glabra acts as antiseptic because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds possess antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria and other pathogens. The alkaloids in the plant help reduce inflammation and prevent infection. Flavonoids contribute to its ability to neutralize harmful microorganisms.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Treats kidney stones</h2>
<p>Kidney stones, also known as renal calculi or nephrolithiasis, are hard deposits that form in the kidneys and can cause severe pain.</p>
<p>They typically result from the buildup of minerals and salts in the urine, often due to dehydration, diet, or genetic factors.</p>
<p>This condition is more common in men than women and tends to affect individuals with a family history of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Herniaria glabra, a traditional herbal remedy, has been studied for its potential to dissolve and prevent kidney stones by promoting urinary health and reducing mineral crystallization.</p>
