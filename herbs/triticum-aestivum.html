<h2 id="0">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Triticum aestivum gluten, a protein composite found in wheat, plays a crucial role in the structure and elasticity of bread and other baked goods.</p>
<p>While it is a key component for dough development, gluten is also a common allergen for individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Beyond its culinary uses, gluten can contribute to the overall nutritional profile of wheat by binding with other compounds, such as starch and fiber, to enhance the texture and digestibility of the grain.</p>
<p>In addition to gluten, Triticum aestivum contains starch, which serves as a primary energy source and is easily digestible, providing a quick release of glucose into the bloodstream. The herb also includes dietary fiber, which supports digestive health by promoting regular bowel movements and aiding in the prevention of constipation. Furthermore, Triticum aestivum contains polyphenols, which are natural antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals in the body, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p>These medicinal constituents collectively contribute to the health benefits of wheat-based products when consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet.</p>
