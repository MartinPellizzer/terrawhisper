<p>According to "International immunopharmacology", Leonurus cardiaca reduces inflammation through down-regulation of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IFN-1β.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Reduces stress hormones</h2>
<p>Chronic stress hormone elevation is a condition characterized by prolonged high levels of cortisol and other stress-related hormones in the body.</p>
<p>This health issue, often referred to as hypercortisolism or stress-induced hormonal imbalance, can lead to a range of physical and psychological symptoms.</p>
<p>It is commonly caused by prolonged exposure to stressors such as work pressure, emotional trauma, or lifestyle imbalances.</p>
<p>Individuals experiencing chronic stress, including those with anxiety disorders or burnout, are most likely to suffer from this condition.</p>
<p>The leonurus cardiaca plant has been studied for its potential to reduce stress hormones, offering a natural remedy for those struggling with chronic stress.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/leonurus-cardiaca-benefits-reduces-stress-hormones.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<h3>How this herb helps with reduces stress hormones?</h2>
<p>Leonurus cardiaca reduces stress hormones because it contains bioactive constituents such as alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds have been shown to modulate the body's stress response by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Alkaloids in the plant may inhibit the release of cortisol, a primary stress hormone. Flavonoids contribute by enhancing the activity of enzymes that break down stress-related neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents support a balanced physiological response to stress.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h2>
<p>According to "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", Leonurus cardiaca reduces stress hormones in a positive way by showing anxiolytic activity, particularly in extracts with amino acids such as glycine, valine, and arginine.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Reduces fever quickly</h2>
<p>Fever is a common health condition characterized by an elevated body temperature, often resulting from infection or inflammation.</p>
<p>A high body temperature, also known as hyperthermia or pyrexia, occurs when the body's internal thermostat is disrupted, typically due to viral or bacterial infections.</p>
<p>This condition is frequently experienced by individuals with illnesses such as the flu, common cold, or other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The leonurus cardiaca plant is traditionally used to reduce fever quickly, offering a natural remedy that helps lower body temperature and alleviate discomfort.</p>
<p>Its cooling properties make it a valuable herb in managing fevers, particularly in regions where access to modern medicine is limited.</p>

<img src="/images/herbs/leonurus-cardiaca-benefits-reduces-fever-quickly.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
