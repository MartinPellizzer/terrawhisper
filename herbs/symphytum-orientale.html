It has been historically used in herbal medicine to treat musculoskeletal injuries, such as sprains and strains, due to its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic to the liver, it is generally recommended to avoid long-term or internal use.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, caution is advised when using Symphytum orientale, and it is often applied externally in the form of poultices or salves rather than ingested.</p><h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>Symphytum orientale has several health benefits, such as its ability to support bone healing and reduce inflammation.</p><p>It contains compounds like allantoin, which may promote the regeneration of tissues and aid in the recovery of damaged skin and mucous membranes.
