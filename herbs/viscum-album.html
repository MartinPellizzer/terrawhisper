</ol>
<h2 id="1">Medicinal Parts</h2>
<p>Viscum album fruit, commonly known as the mistletoe fruit, is a small, sticky, white or yellowish berry that contains the seeds of the plant.</p>
<p>These fruits are typically found in clusters and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fruit itself is not usually consumed directly due to its toxic properties, but it plays a crucial role in the plant's reproduction by housing the seeds.</p>
<p>The seeds inside the fruit are encased in a protective coating that helps them adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating their dispersal and growth. In herbal medicine, the seeds are sometimes used to prepare tinctures or extracts, which are believed to have various therapeutic properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects.</p>
<p>However, due to the toxicity of both the fruit and the seeds, their use in medicinal applications is highly regulated and requires careful preparation to ensure safety.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations</h2>
<p>Viscum album tinctures are commonly used in herbal medicine for their purported immune-boosting and antiviral properties, often prepared by soaking the plant material in alcohol to extract its active compounds.</p>
<p>These tinctures are typically taken orally in small doses and are believed to support the body's defenses against infections. In addition to tinctures, Viscum album can be brewed into teas or decoctions, though these methods may be less effective due to the herb's limited water solubility.</p>
<p>Capsules and syrups offer convenient alternatives for those seeking standardized dosages or easier administration, particularly for children or the elderly. The herb is also incorporated into lozenges, creams, and ointments for localized application, such as in respiratory or skin conditions, although the efficacy of these forms may vary. While some traditional preparations like mucillages and poultices have been used historically, modern formulations often prioritize tinctures and capsules for consistency and potency.</p>
<p>Overall, Viscum album remains a subject of interest in herbal medicine, with various preparations aimed at harnessing its potential therapeutic benefits.</p>
