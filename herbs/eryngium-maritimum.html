<p>Eryngium maritimum furanocoumarins are a class of phototoxic compounds that exhibit antimicrobial and antifungal properties, and they are responsible for the plant's characteristic skin irritation when exposed to sunlight, known as phytophotodermatitis.</p>
<p>Eryngium maritimum polyphenols, which include flavonoids and phenolic acids, are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to the herb's potential therapeutic applications in treating oxidative stress-related conditions.</p>
<p>Eryngium maritimum sesquiterpene lactones are biologically active compounds that display anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and immunomodulatory properties, making them of interest in pharmaceutical research.</p>
<p>Eryngium maritimum fatty acids, particularly unsaturated ones like linoleic and oleic acid, contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory and skin-healing properties, supporting its traditional use in dermatological treatments.</p>

<h2 id="2">Herbal Preparations of eryngium maritimum</h2>
<p>Eryngium maritimum teas are commonly prepared by steeping the dried herb in hot water, and they are often used to support digestive health and reduce inflammation due to their high content of flavonoids and antioxidants.</p>
