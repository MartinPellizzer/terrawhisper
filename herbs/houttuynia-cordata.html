<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2><p>Houttuynia cordata has several health benefits, such as its ability to support immune function due to its high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p><p>It is known to help reduce oxidative stress in the body, which may lower the risk of chronic diseases. Some studies suggest that it may have antimicrobial properties that could aid in fighting infections.

Flavonoids like quercetin and isorhamnetin are known for their ability to neutralize free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage. Terpenoids, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, contribute to the plant's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.</p><p>Additionally, the presence of volatile oils enhances its therapeutic potential in treating respiratory and skin infections.</p><h2 id="3">Preparations</h2><p>Houttuynia cordata has several medicinal preparations, such as teas, tinctures, and topical salves, that have been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p><p>One common method is brewing the fresh leaves into a tea, which is believed to help with respiratory issues and skin conditions. Tinctures made from the plant are often used to treat infections and inflammation due to their antimicrobial properties. In some regions, the leaves are applied directly to the skin as a poultice to reduce swelling and promote healing.</p><p>These preparations are valued for their potential therapeutic benefits, though they should be used with caution and under professional guidance.</p><h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2><p>Houttuynia cordata can have some side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large amounts.</p><p>Prolonged use of this herb may lead to liver toxicity, as it contains compounds that can be harmful in high doses. Allergic reactions, such as skin rashes or itching, may occur in individuals sensitive to the plant. In rare cases, excessive consumption has been linked to respiratory issues or even more severe systemic effects.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using houttuynia cordata, particularly for long-term or therapeutic purposes.</p>
