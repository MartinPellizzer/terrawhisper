<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Symphytum officinale bath has been used to promote healing and alleviate pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Roman and medieval European traditions for its purported ability to ease injuries, particularly in the bones and joints. Traditionally, the plant, also known as comfrey, was prepared as a poultice or infused into water for topical application to wounds and sprains. In modern times, while its use is more cautious due to potential toxicity, some still use it in diluted forms for minor skin irritations or as a soothing bath for muscle aches.</p>
<p>Its continued use reflects a blend of traditional knowledge and evolving safety considerations in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
