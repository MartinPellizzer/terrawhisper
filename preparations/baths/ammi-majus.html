In traditional herbal practices, it was also believed to aid in detoxification and alleviate respiratory issues. Modern applications include its use in aromatherapy and as a natural remedy for eczema and psoriasis due to its anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>However, its use today is less common, though some holistic practitioners still recommend it for its soothing and purifying qualities.</p>

The bath can also help detoxify the body and improve overall well-being through its aromatic and therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Regular use of Ammi majus bath may contribute to a sense of calm and balance, making it a valuable addition to holistic self-care routines.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Soak in the bath for 20-30 minutes to benefit from its soothing and antiseptic properties.</p>
