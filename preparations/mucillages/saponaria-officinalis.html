<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Saponaria officinalis mucillage active constituents include mucilage, saponins, flavonoids, and tannins.</p>
<p>Mucilage is a gel-like substance that coats and soothes irritated tissues, making it beneficial for digestive and respiratory health.

Flavonoids contribute to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, while tannins provide astringent properties that can help in reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Saponaria officinalis mucillage, start by harvesting the fresh or dried aerial parts of the plant, preferably during the flowering period.</p>
<p>Wash the plant material thoroughly and place it in a pot with twice its volume of distilled water. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and let it steep for about 30 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to separate the mucilage-rich residue from the liquid.</p>
<p>Allow the extracted mucilage to cool and store it in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Saponaria officinalis mucillage may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high mucilage content.</p>
