<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to release the mucilage. Place the chopped leaves in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to collect the mucilage, which can then be used as a soothing herbal preparation.</p>

<p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family, such as ragweed.
