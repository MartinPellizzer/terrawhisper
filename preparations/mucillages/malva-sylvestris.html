<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Malva sylvestris mucillage has been used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Greek and Roman medicine for its soothing properties, particularly for coughs and sore throats. In traditional herbal practices, it was also used to alleviate inflammation and as a demulcent to protect and soothe mucous membranes. Modern applications include its use in herbal remedies for conditions like bronchitis, gastritis, and as a natural thickener in food products.</p>
<p>Today, it is still appreciated for its mild, mucilage-rich properties that support digestive and respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Malva sylvestris mucillage active constituents include mucilage, flavonoids, tannins, and polysaccharides.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Malva sylvestris mucillage, begin by harvesting the leaves of the plant, preferably when they are young and tender, as they contain the highest concentration of mucilage.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and soak them in cold water for several hours or overnight to allow the mucilage to dissolve.

The resulting mucilage can be used directly or further concentrated by simmering gently over low heat.</p>
<p>This preparation is known for its soothing properties and is commonly used in herbal medicine for its demulcent and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
