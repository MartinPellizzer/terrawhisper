<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Valeriana officinalis mucillage, start by harvesting the roots of the plant during the autumn season when the mucilage content is highest.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. Place the chopped roots in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about 2 inches. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for approximately 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</p>
