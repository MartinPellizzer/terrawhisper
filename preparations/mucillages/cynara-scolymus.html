<p>Its applications continue to expand in both traditional and complementary medicine fields.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Cynara scolymus mucillage has health benefits such as supporting digestive health, reducing inflammation, and promoting liver function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cynara scolymus mucillage, first gather fresh or dried leaves of the artichoke plant, which is the source of this herbal preparation.</p>
<p>Next, wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and let it cook for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, allowing the mucilage to dissolve into the water.</p>
