<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Lavandula angustifolia mucillage, begin by harvesting fresh lavender flowers during the early morning when they are at their peak potency.</p>
<p>Next, place the flowers in a clean glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality alcohol such as vodka or brandy, ensuring the liquid is at least 1 inch above the flowers. Allow the mixture to steep in a dark, cool place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days to facilitate extraction. After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to separate the liquid from the plant material.</p>
