<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Thymus vulgaris linctuse has been used to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs, bronchitis, and sore throats for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Greece and Rome for its expectorant properties and was often used to alleviate symptoms of colds and flu. In traditional medicine, it was also believed to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, making it a popular remedy for respiratory infections. Modern research supports its use as a natural expectorant and bronchodilator, with studies highlighting its potential in managing chronic respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>It is commonly used to relieve coughs and sore throats due to its expectorant and soothing effects.

<p>Overall, Thymus vulgaris linctuse is a valuable herbal remedy for supporting respiratory and immune wellness.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Thymus vulgaris linctuse active constituents include thymol, carvacrol, terpenes, and flavonoids.</p>
<p>These compounds contribute to its expectorant and antimicrobial properties, making it useful for respiratory health.

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Next, place the leaves in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for approximately 15 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, add a small amount of honey or sugar to the liquid and stir until it thickens slightly, creating a soothing herbal syrup.</p>
