<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Ruscus aculeatus linctuse, begin by gathering fresh or dried leaves of the plant Ruscus aculeatus, also known as butcherâ€™s broom.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a jar and cover them with a high-quality alcohol such as vodka or brandy, ensuring the leaves are fully submerged. Let the mixture steep for at least four weeks in a cool, dark place, shaking the jar occasionally to promote infusion.</p>
<p>After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and store the linctuse in a dark glass bottle away from light.</p>

Prolonged use could potentially affect liver function, as some herbal preparations have been linked to hepatic toxicity. Individuals with pre-existing liver conditions should avoid this preparation altogether.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, increasing the risk of adverse effects.</p>
