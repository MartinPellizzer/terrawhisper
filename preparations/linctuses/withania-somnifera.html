<p>Scientific research is ongoing to explore its active compounds and confirm its efficacy in contemporary medical applications.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Withania somnifera linctuse, start by washing and drying the Withania somnifera roots thoroughly.</p>
<p>Next, grind the dried roots into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. In a saucepan, combine the powdered roots with a small amount of water and bring it to a gentle simmer over low heat. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 15-20 minutes, then strain the liquid through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any solid particles.</p>
<p>Finally, mix the strained liquid with a sweetener of your choice, such as honey or sugar, to create a syrupy consistency suitable for use as a linctuse.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Withania somnifera linctuse may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its potent alkaloid content.</p>

Long-term use could potentially lead to liver toxicity, as some studies suggest it may affect hepatic function. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or blood pressure.</p>
<p>Users should consult a healthcare provider before using this preparation, especially if they have pre-existing medical conditions or are on other medications.</p>
