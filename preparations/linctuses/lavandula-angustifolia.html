<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia linctuse has health benefits such as soothing respiratory tract irritation, reducing coughing, and easing symptoms of sore throat.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Lavandula angustifolia linctuse, start by harvesting fresh lavender flowers from the plant, ensuring they are fully open and free from pesticides.</p>
