In modern times, it is commonly used as a natural remedy for conditions like irregular periods, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and breast tenderness. Its active compounds, including flavonoids and iridoids, are believed to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus linctuse has health benefits such as supporting hormonal balance, particularly in women, by regulating menstrual cycles and alleviating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).</p>
<p>It is often used to address issues related to the reproductive system, including irregular periods and mood swings. The preparation may also help reduce breast tenderness and promote emotional well-being. Its phytoestrogenic properties can support menopausal symptoms by mimicking the effects of estrogen in the body.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is believed to enhance fertility and improve overall reproductive health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus linctuse active constituents include compounds such as flavonoids, iridoids, and essential oils.</p>
<p>These compounds are believed to contribute to its traditional use in supporting hormonal balance and reproductive health. Flavonoids may help regulate menstrual cycles and alleviate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Iridoids, such as aucubin, are thought to have anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>Essential oils in the preparation may provide additional support for digestive and respiratory wellness.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Vitex agnus-castus linctuse, first gather 10 grams of dried Vitex agnus-castus fruit and 250 ml of a neutral spirit such as vodka or alcohol.</p>
<p>Place the fruit in a clean glass jar and pour the alcohol over it, ensuring the fruit is fully submerged. Seal the jar and store it in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking it gently every few days. After the infusion period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>The resulting tincture can be taken in small doses, typically 20-40 drops diluted in water, as needed for its traditional uses.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus linctuse may lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly in women, due to its influence on the pituitary gland and menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>It is commonly used for regulating menstrual irregularities and alleviating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. However, possible side effects include nausea, headaches, and breast tenderness. Long-term use may cause irregular menstrual cycles or exacerbate existing hormonal conditions.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with a history of hormone-sensitive conditions.</p>
