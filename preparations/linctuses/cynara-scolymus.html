<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Cynara scolymus linctuse has been used to treat respiratory conditions such as coughs, bronchitis, and sore throats for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional medicine systems, including ancient Greek and Roman practices, where it was used to soothe inflammation and ease breathing. In modern herbal medicine, it is still employed as a natural remedy for respiratory discomfort due to its expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties. The preparation often involves infusing the leaves or flowers in oil or alcohol to create a tincture or syrup.</p>
<p>Today, it is also being studied for its potential antioxidant and immune-supporting benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Cynara scolymus linctuse has health benefits such as supporting digestive health, reducing inflammation, and promoting liver function.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation, derived from the artichoke plant, is known for its high concentration of antioxidants and compounds like cynarins, which aid in detoxification.

<p>Its mild and soothing properties make it a popular choice for natural remedies in various health practices.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Cynara scolymus linctuse active constituents include sesquiterpene lactones, polyphenols, flavonoids, and mucilage.</p>

<p>Mucilage acts as a demulcent, providing a protective coating to irritated mucous membranes.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cynara scolymus linctuse, begin by harvesting fresh artichoke leaves and stems, ensuring they are clean and free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Wash and chop the leaves and stems into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped plant material in a pot and cover it with a sufficient amount of water, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 30 minutes to extract the beneficial compounds.</p>
<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove plant residue, and allow the resulting infusion to cool before use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
