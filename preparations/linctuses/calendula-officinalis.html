<p>This herbal preparation is often used to alleviate symptoms of coughs and sore throats due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Calendula officinalis linctuse, start by harvesting fresh or dried Calendula flowers, ensuring they are free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Next, grind the flowers into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a food processor. In a saucepan, combine the powdered flowers with a small amount of water and simmer gently for about 15 minutes to create a syrupy consistency. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any remaining solids.</p>
<p>Finally, mix the strained liquid with a sweetener such as honey or sugar to achieve the desired taste and texture of the linctuse.</p>

<p>It can also cause allergic reactions such as skin rashes, itching, or more severe symptoms in people with known allergies to plants in the Asteraceae family. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, although this is rare. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p>
<p>Always follow the recommended dosage to minimize the risk of adverse effects.</p>
