<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus linctuse has been used to support immune function and treat respiratory conditions for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its ability to enhance vitality and promote longevity, often prescribed for chronic fatigue and weakened immunity. In traditional practices, it was also used to alleviate coughs and bronchial issues, particularly in the form of a soothing syrup. Modern research suggests it may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, supporting its traditional use in respiratory health.</p>
<p>Today, it is still utilized in herbal formulations to boost the immune system and manage conditions like asthma and chronic bronchitis.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus linctuse has health benefits such as enhancing immune function, supporting respiratory health, and promoting overall vitality.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbal medicine to strengthen the body's defenses against infections and illnesses. The preparation may help reduce inflammation and improve lung function, making it beneficial for individuals with chronic respiratory conditions. It is also believed to have antioxidant properties that contribute to cellular health and longevity.</p>
<p>However, it should be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare practitioner to ensure safety and efficacy.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus linctuse active constituents include polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids, and amino acids.</p>
<p>These compounds are known to support immune function and have anti-inflammatory properties. Polysaccharides are particularly noted for their ability to enhance the activity of immune cells. Saponins contribute to the preparation's antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>Flavonoids and amino acids further support overall health by reducing oxidative stress and promoting cellular repair.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Astragalus membranaceus linctuse, first, gather fresh or dried roots of Astragalus membranaceus.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and slice them into thin pieces to enhance extraction. Place the sliced roots in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>After simmering, strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and allow the decoction to cool before use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus linctuse may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions, including skin rashes and itching, in people sensitive to the herb. Long-term use might result in immune system overstimulation, leading to inflammation or autoimmune-like symptoms. There is limited research on its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding, so caution is advised.</p>
<p>Additionally, interactions with certain medications, particularly immunosuppressants, may occur, potentially altering their effectiveness.</p>
