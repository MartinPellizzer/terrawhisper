Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10 minutes until it becomes a thick, syrup-like consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any impurities, and let it cool before storing in a dark, airtight container.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
