<p>Boswellia serrata tincture is a concentrated liquid extract made from the resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, commonly known as Indian frankincense.</p>
<p>It is widely used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The tincture is typically prepared by soaking the resin in alcohol to extract its active compounds, such as boswellic acids. In herbalism, it is often used to support joint health, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis.</p>
<p>It may also be employed for its potential effects on respiratory and digestive health.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata tincture lowers blood pressure by promoting vascular health and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>It eases arthritis pain through its anti-inflammatory properties that inhibit enzymes involved in inflammation. The tincture fights osteoarthritis pain by reducing joint swelling and improving mobility. It also reduces inflammation throughout the body, supporting overall immune function.</p>
<p>Additionally, Boswellia serrata tincture fights anxiety attacks by modulating stress hormones and calming the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata tincture contains boswellic acids, which are known for their potent anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties.</p>
<p>Among these, acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most bioavailable and effective form, contributing significantly to the tincture's therapeutic effects. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid are also present, offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that support overall cellular health. Quercetin, a flavonoid, enhances the tincture's antioxidant capacity and may synergize with boswellic acids to improve efficacy.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Boswellia serrata tincture a valuable supplement for managing inflammatory conditions and promoting wellness.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Boswella serrata tincture is primarily made from the resinous sap extracted from the bark of the tree.</p>
<p>The most commonly used part of the plant is the inner bark, which contains high concentrations of active compounds like boswellic acids. This resin is collected by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to flow and harden into a gum-like substance. The leaves and roots are less frequently used in tincture preparation compared to the bark.</p>
<p>However, in some traditional formulations, the leaves may be included for additional therapeutic properties.</p>
