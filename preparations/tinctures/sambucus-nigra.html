<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tincture has been used to treat a variety of ailments throughout history, including colds, flu, and respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it was valued in European folk medicine for its antiviral and immune-boosting properties, often prepared from the berries or flowers of the elder tree. In modern times, it is commonly used as a natural remedy to alleviate symptoms of viral infections and support immune function. Some studies suggest it may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
<p>Today, it is available as a dietary supplement and is sometimes used in alternative medicine practices.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tincture has health benefits such as supporting immune function, reducing inflammation, and promoting respiratory health.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of colds, flu, and bronchitis due to its antiviral and antioxidant properties. The tincture may also help in managing fever and improving circulation. Additionally, it has been traditionally used to support liver health and detoxification processes.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tincture active constituents include flavonoids, sambucol, mucilage, and essential oils.</p>
<p>These compounds are believed to contribute to the tincture's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-supporting properties. Flavonoids help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Sambucol, a unique glycoprotein, is thought to enhance immune function and may have antiviral effects.</p>
<p>Mucilage provides soothing effects on the respiratory and digestive tracts, making it beneficial for coughs and gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Sambucus nigra tincture, first gather fresh or dried elderberries and combine them with a high-proof alcohol such as vodka or grain alcohol.</p>
<p>Place the mixture in a glass jar and let it steep for four to six weeks in a cool, dark place, shaking it occasionally. After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material. Finally, store the tincture in a dark glass bottle in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.</p>
<p>This preparation is often used for its potential immune-supporting properties.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tincture may lead to gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, particularly with high doses or prolonged use.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or respiratory symptoms. Long-term use may interfere with blood sugar levels, making it potentially risky for people with diabetes. There is also a risk of liver damage, especially when combined with certain medications or consumed in excessive amounts.</p>
<p>Due to these potential side effects, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Sambucus nigra tincture.</p>
