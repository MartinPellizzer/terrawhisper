<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tincture has anti oxidant properties that help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress in the body.</p>
<p>It also exhibits anti bacterial effects, making it useful in fighting infections caused by various pathogens. This tincture supports the immune system by enhancing the body's natural defenses against illness. Additionally, it contains compounds with isolate anti inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the body.</p>
<p>Lastly, it supports liver detoxification by promoting the elimination of toxins and improving liver function.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tincture contains baicalein, a potent flavonoid known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Alongside baicalein, the tincture also includes baicalin, which is a glycoside derivative of baicalein and is recognized for its ability to support liver function and reduce oxidative stress. Polysaccharides present in the tincture contribute to immune modulation and may enhance the body's natural defenses. Flavonoids, a broad class of compounds found in the tincture, offer additional benefits such as neuroprotection and cardiovascular support.</p>
<p>Finally, wogonin, another key bioactive constituent, exhibits antimicrobial and anticancer activities, making the tincture a valuable source of therapeutic compounds.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tincture is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain high concentrations of active compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part due to their potent medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. While the leaves are sometimes used, they are less prevalent in tincture formulations compared to the roots. The flowers and seeds are occasionally included but are not as significant in traditional preparations.</p>
<p>Overall, the roots remain the most critical component in the production of Scutellaria baicalensis tincture.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tincture can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its bitter compounds and active ingredients like baicalin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or hives in individuals sensitive to its components. Some users may experience dizziness or headaches as a result of its effects on the central nervous system. Long-term use could potentially lead to liver toxicity, especially when combined with other hepatotoxic substances.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, particularly for those with pre-existing medical conditions or on other medications.</p>
