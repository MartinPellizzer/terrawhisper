<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Paeonia lactiflora tincture, first gather fresh or dried roots of the peony plant, ensuring they are clean and free from contaminants.</p>

Seal the jar and let it sit in a dark, cool place for four to six weeks, shaking it occasionally to ensure even extraction.</p>
<p>After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to separate the tincture from the plant material, then store it in a dark glass bottle away from light.</p>
