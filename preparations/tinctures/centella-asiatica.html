<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tincture improves skin texture by promoting collagen synthesis and enhancing skin elasticity, leading to a smoother and more radiant complexion.</p>
<p>It protects against oxidation by containing potent antioxidants that neutralize free radicals, thereby reducing cellular damage and aging. This tincture supports wound healing by stimulating the production of collagen and enhancing the repair of damaged tissues. Additionally, it boosts brain function and enhances cognitive power through its ability to improve blood circulation and reduce mental fatigue.</p>
<p>Overall, Centella asiatica tincture offers a range of health benefits that support both skin health and cognitive well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tincture contains triterpenoid glycosides, which are known for their wound-healing and skin-repairing properties.</p>
<p>These compounds work synergistically with triterpenoid saponins, which enhance cellular membrane integrity and promote tissue regeneration. Asiatic acid and madecassoside, two key triterpenoids, are renowned for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Additionally, triterpene esters contribute to the tincture's ability to improve circulation and support cognitive function.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Centella asiatica tincture a valuable remedy for various dermatological and neurological conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tincture is primarily made from the leaves of the plant, which contain the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of triterpenoids like asiatic acid and madecassic acid. While the roots are occasionally used, they are less prevalent in tincture preparation compared to the leaves. The stems and aerial parts may also be included in some formulations, but the leaves remain the primary source.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves are the most utilized component in the production of Centella asiatica tincture.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tincture can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when taken in high doses.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as skin rashes, itching, or hives in individuals sensitive to the herb. Some users may experience dizziness or headaches due to its effects on blood pressure and circulation. Long-term use could potentially interfere with liver function, though more research is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are on medication.</p>
