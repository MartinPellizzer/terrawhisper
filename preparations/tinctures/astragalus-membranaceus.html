<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Astragalus membranaceus tincture, start by gathering high-quality dried roots of the plant.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase surface area for better extraction. Place the chopped roots in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-proof alcohol such as vodka or grain alcohol. Seal the jar and store it in a dark, cool place, shaking it gently every few days for four to six weeks.</p>
<p>After the infusion period, strain the liquid through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove the plant material, and store the tincture in a dark glass bottle away from light.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tincture may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, particularly when taken in high doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the legume family. Long-term use might interfere with immune system function, potentially suppressing it in some cases. There is a risk of interactions with medications, especially immunosuppressants and chemotherapy drugs.</p>
<p>Additionally, some users may experience insomnia or restlessness due to its stimulating properties.</p>
