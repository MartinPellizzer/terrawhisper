<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tincture reduces inflammation by modulating the body's immune response and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>It supports liver function by enhancing detoxification processes and protecting liver cells from oxidative stress. The tincture also supports the respiratory system by improving lung function and reducing symptoms of respiratory infections. Additionally, it boosts the immune system through the stimulation of white blood cell production and antibody formation.</p>
<p>Finally, it fights infections by increasing the body's natural defenses against viruses and bacteria.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tincture contains phenylethanoid glycosides, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides in the tincture contribute to immune modulation and enhance the body's defense mechanisms. Saponins provide additional immune support and may help in reducing cholesterol levels. Astragalosides, a group of glycosides, are believed to have cardioprotective and anti-aging effects.</p>
<p>Monosaccharides in the tincture serve as a source of energy and may aid in the absorption of other bioactive compounds.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tincture is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as polysaccharides and flavonoids.</p>
<p>The roots are typically harvested in the autumn when their medicinal properties are most potent. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used, they are less common in tincture preparation due to lower active compound content. The root is dried and then macerated in alcohol to extract its beneficial properties.</p>
<p>This makes the root the most valuable and frequently used part of the plant in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
