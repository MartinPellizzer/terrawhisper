<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata tincture fights infections by boosting the immune system and inhibiting the growth of pathogens.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation through its active compounds, which help alleviate symptoms in conditions like arthritis and respiratory infections. The tincture is effective in treating fever by regulating body temperature and supporting the body's natural healing processes. It fights bacterial infections due to its antimicrobial properties that target various types of harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>Additionally, it improves immunity by enhancing the production of white blood cells and other immune responses.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata tincture contains andrographolide, a major bioactive compound known for its potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</p>
<p>Alongside andrographolide, the tincture also includes neoadrographolide, which exhibits similar therapeutic effects but with a different molecular structure. Dihydrodehydroandrographolide and 14-deoxyandrographolide are additional derivatives that contribute to the plant's overall pharmacological profile by enhancing immune response and reducing oxidative stress. Polysaccharides present in the tincture further support immune function and may have antimicrobial and antiviral activities.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents make Andrographis paniculata tincture a valuable herbal remedy for various inflammatory and immune-related conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata tincture primarily utilizes the leaves of the plant, as they contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as andrographolide.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested during the plant's flowering stage to maximize their medicinal potency. While the roots are also used in some formulations, they are less common compared to the leaves. The stems may be included in certain preparations but are usually secondary to the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most critical component in the production of Andrographis paniculata tincture.</p>
