<p>Angelica sinensis tincture is a concentrated liquid extract made from the dried roots of the Angelica sinensis plant, commonly known as dong quai.</p>
<p>It is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and herbalism for its purported ability to support hormonal balance and promote circulation. This preparation is often taken to alleviate symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and mood swings, and is also used to address menstrual irregularities. It is typically diluted in water or alcohol before consumption to reduce its potency and potential side effects.</p>
<p>Due to its potential interactions with medications, it should be used under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tincture reduces inflammation by containing active compounds that inhibit inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of white blood cells and antibodies. The tincture can relieve headaches by improving blood circulation and reducing tension in the muscles of the head and neck. It eases pain through its analgesic properties, which help in managing conditions like arthritis and menstrual cramps.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces stress by promoting relaxation and balancing hormonal levels, contributing to overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tincture contains ligustilide, a major bioactive compound known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Butylphthalide, another key constituent, contributes to the tincture's ability to improve blood circulation and reduce menstrual cramps. Quercetin, a flavonoid, provides antioxidant and anti-cancer benefits, enhancing the overall therapeutic profile of the tincture. Ursolic acid supports immune function and has anti-inflammatory effects, making it valuable in treating various health conditions.</p>
<p>Beta-sitosterol helps lower cholesterol levels and may also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tincture primarily utilizes the roots of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as ligustilide and ferulic acid.</p>
<p>The roots are typically harvested in the autumn when their medicinal properties are most potent. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used, they are less common in tincture preparation due to lower active compound content. The root is dried and then soaked in alcohol to extract its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>This makes the root the most crucial part of the Angelica sinensis plant for medicinal tincture production.</p>
