<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tincture reduces stress levels by modulating the body's response to stressors and supporting the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>It boosts mood naturally through its adaptogenic properties, which help balance neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. The tincture enhances cognitive function by improving mental clarity and increasing alertness. It increases mental focus by promoting better concentration and reducing mental fatigue.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces anxiety symptoms by calming the nervous system and lowering cortisol levels.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tincture contains rosavin, which is one of the primary bioactive compounds known for its adaptogenic properties and ability to enhance physical and mental performance.</p>
<p>Salidroside, another key constituent, contributes to the tincture's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting stress resistance and cellular health. Triterpene saponins in the tincture help in modulating immune function and may aid in reducing inflammation. Rosarin, a unique compound found in Rhodiola rosea, is believed to support energy production and mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>Caffeic acid, a phenolic compound, enhances the overall antioxidant capacity of the tincture and may contribute to its neuroprotective properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tincture is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as rosavins and salidrosides.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part for medicinal purposes due to their potent adaptogenic properties. While leaves and stems may also be used in some formulations, they are less prevalent compared to the roots. The root's ability to store and concentrate these beneficial compounds makes it the preferred choice for tincture production.</p>
<p>Overall, the roots are the most essential and widely utilized part of the Rhodiola rosea plant in traditional and modern herbal medicine.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
