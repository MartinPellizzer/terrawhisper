<p>Terminalia chebula tincture fights cancer cells by inhibiting the growth of malignant tumors and inducing apoptosis in cancerous cells.</p>
<p>It reduces oxidative stress by acting as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that damage cells and tissues. This tincture also reduces fever quickly by modulating the body's inflammatory response and lowering body temperature.

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tincture contains triterpenoids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>These compounds contribute to the tincture's ability to support digestive health and enhance immune function.

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tincture primarily utilizes the fruit, which is the most commonly used part of the plant for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The dried fruit, often referred to as chebulic myrobalan, is ground into a powder and then used to make the tincture. The fruit contains high levels of tannins, which contribute to its astringent and healing effects. In addition to the fruit, the bark is sometimes used in the preparation of the tincture, especially in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>The leaves and roots are less commonly used but may be included in certain formulations for their additional therapeutic benefits.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tincture can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially in people sensitive to its components. Long-term use might result in liver toxicity, so it should be used under medical supervision. Additionally, it can interact with certain medications, potentially reducing their effectiveness or increasing side effects.</p>
<p>Always consult a healthcare provider before starting this tincture, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.</p>
