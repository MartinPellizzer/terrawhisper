<p>Despite its long history, ongoing scientific studies continue to explore its full range of therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties.

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

The flavonoids help in strengthening blood vessels and improving circulation.</p>
<p>Overall, these active constituents make Terminalia chebula tincture beneficial for digestive health, immune support, and skin care.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Terminalia chebula tincture, first gather 100 grams of dried Terminalia chebula fruit and 500 ml of a high-proof alcohol, such as 40-50% ethanol.</p>
<p>Place the fruit in a glass jar and pour the alcohol over it, ensuring the fruit is fully submerged. Seal the jar and store it in a dark, cool place, shaking it daily for four weeks. After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove the plant material.</p>
