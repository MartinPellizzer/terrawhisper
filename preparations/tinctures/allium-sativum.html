<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Allium sativum tincture lower blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and reducing oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>It also reduces inflammation through its rich content of sulfur compounds, which inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body. This tincture supports the immune system by enhancing the production of white blood cells and antibodies. Additionally, it can heal digestive issues by soothing the gastrointestinal tract and reducing symptoms of indigestion and ulcers.</p>
<p>Finally, some studies suggest that it may help fight cancer cells due to its ability to induce apoptosis in malignant cells.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Allium sativum tincture contains allicin, a sulfur compound known for its potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alongside allicin, diallyl disulfide contributes to the tincture's ability to support cardiovascular health and reduce oxidative stress. Sulfenic acid, another key component, plays a role in the body's defense mechanisms by neutralizing free radicals. Additionally, sulfur compounds in the tincture may aid in digestion and help lower cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Quercetin, a flavonoid present in small amounts, enhances the antioxidant effects and supports immune function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Allium sativum tincture primarily utilizes the bulb, which is the most commonly used part of the plant for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The bulb contains a high concentration of sulfur compounds, such as allicin, that contribute to its therapeutic effects. While the leaves are occasionally used, they are less common in tincture preparation compared to the bulb. The roots of Allium sativum are not typically used in tinctures due to their minimal contribution to the active compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the bulb remains the most essential and effective part for making medicinal tinctures from this plant.</p>
