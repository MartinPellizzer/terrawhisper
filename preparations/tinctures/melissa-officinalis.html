<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis tincture relieves stress levels by promoting calmness and reducing cortisol production, making it an effective natural remedy for daily tension.</p>
<p>It also boosts the immune system through its rich content of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that support overall wellness. The tincture treats anxiety symptoms by balancing mood and enhancing emotional resilience, offering a soothing effect on the nervous system. Additionally, it eases insomnia issues by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality, aiding in restful nights.</p>
<p>Lastly, Melissa officinalis tincture heals skin irritations due to its antiseptic and soothing properties that reduce inflammation and promote skin healing.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis tincture contains rosmarinic acid, a potent antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation and supports skin health.</p>
<p>It also includes apigenin, a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Luteolin, another bioactive compound present, contributes to its anti-cancer and anti-allergic effects. Quercetin, known for its strong antioxidant and antiviral activities, further enhances the tincture's therapeutic value.</p>
<p>Chlorogenic acid, which aids in detoxification and supports metabolic processes, completes the profile of this beneficial herbal extract.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis tincture is most commonly made using the leaves and flowers of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentration of active compounds like flavonoids and volatile oils.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested during the early flowering stage to ensure maximum potency, while the flowers are often used in combination to enhance the therapeutic effects. The roots of Melissa officinalis are rarely used in tinctures due to their minimal contribution to the overall medicinal profile. Instead, the aerial parts, particularly the leaves and flowers, are preferred for their aromatic and calming properties.</p>
<p>These components are typically infused in alcohol or glycerin to create a potent and effective herbal remedy.</p>
