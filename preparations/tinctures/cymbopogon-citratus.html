<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tincture reduces inflammation by containing active compounds like citral and geraniol, which have potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing the body's defense mechanisms. The tincture relieves joint pain due to its ability to inhibit inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress. It eases digestion issues by promoting the secretion of digestive enzymes and reducing gastrointestinal spasms.</p>
<p>Additionally, it lowers blood pressure by acting as a natural vasodilator, improving circulation and reducing cardiovascular strain.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tincture contains citral, which is the primary bioactive constituent responsible for its characteristic lemon scent and potent antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Limonene and d-limonene are also present, contributing to its aromatic profile and exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Geraniol, another key component, possesses antimicrobial, antifungal, and potential anti-cancer properties. Linalool adds to the tincture's calming effects and has been shown to have sedative and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents make Cymbopogon citratus tincture a valuable natural remedy with a wide range of therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tincture is primarily made using the leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly harvested part due to their high concentration of essential oils.</p>
<p>The leaves contain compounds like citral, which contribute to the plant's medicinal properties and aromatic qualities. While the roots are occasionally used, they are less common in tincture production compared to the leaves. The stems may also be utilized, but they are typically processed alongside the leaves to enhance the overall potency of the tincture.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves are the most used part, followed by the stems, with the roots playing a minor role in the formulation.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tincture can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially in people sensitive to citrus compounds. Headaches and dizziness are commonly reported side effects, particularly with higher doses. Prolonged use might result in liver toxicity, though this is rare.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this tincture, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or on medication.</p>
