<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tincture reduce inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory markers in the body, which can help alleviate symptoms of chronic conditions.</p>
<p>It also improves memory by enhancing cognitive function and increasing blood flow to the brain. The tincture regulates blood pressure through its vasodilatory effects, promoting cardiovascular health. Additionally, it improves circulation by stimulating the production of nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels.</p>
<p>Lastly, it boosts the body's antioxidant defenses, protecting cells from oxidative stress and aging.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tincture contains phytosterols, which are known to support cardiovascular health and may help reduce cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Ginkgolides are unique tricyclic terpene lactones that contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, are potent antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals and improve circulation. Bilobalide, another important compound, enhances cognitive function by protecting neurons from oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Biflavonoids, like ginkgetin, further support circulatory health and may enhance the effects of other bioactive compounds in the tincture.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tincture is primarily made from the leaves of the tree, which are the most commonly used part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain flavonoids and terpene lactones, compounds known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. While the roots are occasionally used in traditional medicine, they are less common in modern tincture formulations due to lower concentrations of active compounds. The bark and seeds are generally not used in tinctures because of potential toxicity or low efficacy.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most valuable and widely utilized part of the Ginkgo biloba plant in medicinal preparations.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tincture can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when taken in high doses.</p>
<p>It may also lead to headaches or dizziness in some individuals. Allergic reactions, such as skin rash or itching, are possible, particularly in people sensitive to the plant. Interactions with blood-thinning medications can increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Due to its effects on the central nervous system, it may also cause insomnia or restlessness in certain users.</p>
