<p>Eurycoma longifolia tincture is a concentrated herbal preparation made from the roots of the Eurycoma longifolia plant, commonly known as Tongkat Ali.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in Southeast Asian herbal medicine for its purported effects on energy, vitality, and sexual health. The tincture is typically prepared by soaking the dried roots in alcohol to extract their active compounds. It is often used to support physical performance, reduce stress, and enhance libido in both men and women.</p>
<p>Due to its potency, it is usually taken in small doses and is considered a powerful adaptogen in herbalism.</p>

<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Eurycoma longifolia tincture is primarily made from the roots and leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The roots are often preferred due to their high concentration of active compounds like mangostin and other xanthones. Leaves are also widely used, especially in traditional medicine, for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Both parts are typically harvested during specific seasons to maximize their potency.</p>
<p>These components are then extracted using alcohol or other solvents to create the tincture.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Eurycoma longifolia tincture can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its potent active compounds.</p>
<p>It may also lead to insomnia or restlessness as a result of its stimulant properties. Some users report headaches or dizziness, possibly due to increased blood pressure or nervous system stimulation. Allergic reactions, such as rash or itching, are also possible in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or on medication.</p>
