<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Alkaloids and amino acids may aid in energy levels and muscle function, making this preparation popular among athletes and individuals seeking natural health support.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Tribulus terrestris tincture, start by gathering fresh or dried Tribulus terrestris plant material, ensuring it is free from pesticides and contaminants.</p>
<p>Next, place the plant material in a clean glass jar and cover it completely with high-proof alcohol, such as vodka or grain alcohol, leaving about an inch of space at the top. Seal the jar tightly and store it in a cool, dark place, shaking it gently every few days for the next four to six weeks to allow the extraction process to occur. After the steeping period, strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant matter, and collect the tincture in a dark glass bottle.</p>
<p>Store the finished tincture in a cool, dark location, away from direct sunlight, and use it as directed or consult a healthcare professional for proper dosage and application.</p>
