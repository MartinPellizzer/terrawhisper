<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis tincture boost brain power by enhancing cognitive function and increasing mental clarity through its adaptogenic properties.</p>
<p>It promotes healthy aging by supporting cellular repair and reducing oxidative stress, which helps maintain youthful vitality. The tincture protects skin cells by combating free radicals and improving skin elasticity, contributing to a more youthful appearance. It strengthens the immune system by stimulating the production of immune cells and enhancing the body's natural defenses.</p>
<p>Additionally, it calms the nervous system, reducing anxiety and promoting a sense of balance and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis tincture contains schisandrin a, a key lignan that contributes to its adaptogenic and hepatoprotective properties.</p>
<p>Gomisin a, another major lignan, is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting the tincture's therapeutic value. Cellulose, while not bioactive, acts as a structural component and aids in the formulation's stability. Terpenoids present in the tincture offer additional antioxidant and immunomodulatory benefits.</p>
<p>Schisandrin b, similar to schisandrin a, enhances the overall efficacy of the tincture by promoting liver function and reducing oxidative stress.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis tincture is primarily made from the fruit of the plant, which is the most commonly used part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The berries, known as "five-flavor berries," contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as lignans. While the roots and leaves are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when fully ripe to maximize its potency.</p>
<p>The combination of the fruit's unique flavor profile and its medicinal benefits makes it the preferred choice for tincture production.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis tincture can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to headaches or dizziness, especially when taken in high doses. Skin irritation or allergic reactions, including rashes and itching, are possible side effects. Long-term use might result in liver toxicity, particularly in those with pre-existing liver conditions.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this tincture, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health issues.</p>
