<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Capsicum annuum tincture eat antioxidant rich, which helps neutralize harmful free radicals in the body and supports cellular health.</p>
<p>It can fight inflammatory diseases by reducing oxidative stress and modulating inflammatory responses.

It also boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of white blood cells and other immune factors.</p>
<p>Additionally, Capsicum annuum tincture may lower cholesterol levels by improving lipid metabolism and reducing bad cholesterol buildup.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Capsicum annuum tincture contains carotenoids, which are fat-soluble pigments with antioxidant properties that support eye health and skin protection.</p>
<p>It also includes fatty acids, which contribute to its emollient properties and may aid in reducing inflammation. Capsaicin is the primary active compound responsible for the heat in chili peppers and has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Phenolic acids present in the tincture act as natural antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals in the body.</p>
<p>Additionally, terpenes contribute to the tincture's aroma and may possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Capsicum annuum tincture is primarily made from the plant's dried fruits, commonly known as chili peppers, which contain high concentrations of capsaicin and other bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves of Capsicum annuum are also used, though less frequently, as they contain alkaloids and flavonoids that contribute to the tincture's medicinal properties. The roots, while less common in traditional preparations, are sometimes included for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. The stems and seeds may be used in some formulations to enhance the overall potency and therapeutic profile.</p>
<p>However, the most valued part of the plant for medicinal tinctures remains the fruit, due to its high concentration of active compounds.</p>
