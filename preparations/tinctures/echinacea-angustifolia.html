<p>Additionally, echinacoside, a key flavonoid, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that contribute to the tincture's therapeutic effects. The presence of alkaloids in the tincture may enhance immune function and provide antimicrobial benefits. Kaempferol and quercetin, both flavonoids, further support the tincture's anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities.</p>
