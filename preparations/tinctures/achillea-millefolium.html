<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tincture relieves pain by acting as a natural analgesic, helping to ease discomfort from injuries or chronic conditions.</p>
<p>It treats wounds by promoting tissue repair and preventing infection due to its antimicrobial properties. The tincture also treats infections by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi. It reduces inflammation by modulating the body's immune response and decreasing swelling.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can reduce fever by supporting the body's natural cooling mechanisms and enhancing immune function.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tincture contains phytosterols, which help reduce inflammation and support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>It also includes phenolic acids that act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative damage. Flavonoids in the tincture contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Rosmarinic acid is present, offering additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Apigenin, a flavonoid, further enhances the tincture's ability to combat oxidative stress and support immune function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tincture primarily utilizes the leaves and flowers of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as flavonoids and essential oils.</p>
<p>The leaves, which are finely divided and feather-like, are commonly harvested during the early flowering stage for optimal potency. The flowers, typically golden-yellow, are also used and often combined with the leaves to enhance the tincture's therapeutic properties. The roots, while less frequently used, may be included in some formulations for their additional medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most preferred parts for making medicinal tinctures due to their rich chemical composition.</p>
