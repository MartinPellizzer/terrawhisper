<p>Hypericum perforatum tincture is a liquid preparation made by soaking the dried flowers of the St. John's wort plant in alcohol.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in herbalism for its potential mood-enhancing properties and to support mental well-being. This tincture is often taken internally to help alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression and anxiety. It is also used externally for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution due to possible interactions with other medications.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tincture relieves depression symptoms by increasing serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, which are essential for mood regulation.</p>
<p>It also reduces inflammation markers through its anti-inflammatory properties, which can contribute to overall mental and physical well-being. The tincture helps reduce oxidative stress by acting as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Additionally, it can lower anxiety levels by modulating the nervous system and promoting a sense of calm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hypericum perforatum tincture may increase melatonin production, aiding in better sleep quality and regulating the body's circadian rhythm.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tincture contains hyperforin, a key bioactive compound known for its antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alongside hyperforin, quercetin, a flavonoid with strong antioxidant and antiviral effects, is also present. Adhyperforin, a closely related compound to hyperforin, contributes to the tincture's mood-enhancing and neuroprotective benefits. Kaempferol, another flavonoid, supports cardiovascular health and exhibits anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>Hyperoside, a glycoside, aids in reducing inflammation and enhancing the overall therapeutic potential of the tincture.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tincture is primarily made from the leaves and flowers of the plant, which contain the highest concentrations of active compounds such as hypericin and hyperforin.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part due to their abundance and ease of harvesting, while the flowers are often included to enhance the potency of the tincture. The roots are occasionally used but are less common because they contain lower levels of the beneficial compounds. The stems may also be utilized in some preparations, though they are generally not the primary component.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most essential parts for creating an effective and standardized medicinal tincture.</p>
