<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis tincture treats urinary issues by acting as a natural diuretic, helping to flush out toxins and reduce inflammation in the urinary tract.</p>
<p>It also soothes skin irritations due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for conditions like eczema or minor burns. The tincture treats respiratory issues by helping to clear mucus and reduce congestion, providing relief from coughs and colds. It is known to treat kidney stones by promoting the elimination of minerals and preventing the formation of stones.</p>
<p>Additionally, it detoxifies liver tissue by supporting the body's natural detoxification processes and reducing the burden on the liver.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis tincture contains α-pinene, a monoterpene known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Limonene, another volatile compound present, contributes to the tincture's aromatic profile and may support immune function. Sesquiterpenes, which are more complex than monoterpenes, are also present and are associated with antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Phytosterols, found in the tincture, help in reducing cholesterol levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>β-pinene, similar to α-pinene, provides additional anti-inflammatory benefits and may aid in respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis tincture is primarily made using the berries, which are the most commonly utilized part of the plant for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The berries contain essential oils, flavonoids, and other compounds that contribute to the tincture's therapeutic effects. While the leaves and shoots are sometimes used, they are less common compared to the berries. The roots are rarely used in tincture preparation due to their limited availability and lower concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the berries remain the most valued and widely used component in Juniperus communis tinctures.</p>
