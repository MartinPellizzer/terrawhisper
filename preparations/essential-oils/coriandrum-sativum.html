<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Coriandrum sativum essential oil helps lower blood pressure by promoting relaxation and reducing stress-related hypertension.</p>
<p>It also reduces inflammation and pain by containing compounds that inhibit inflammatory responses in the body. This essential oil boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing overall immune function. Additionally, it eases joint pains by acting as a natural anti-inflammatory agent, providing relief for conditions like arthritis.</p>
<p>Finally, it can ease cold symptoms by helping to clear respiratory passages and reduce congestion.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Coriandrum sativum essential oil contains linalool, a monoterpene alcohol known for its calming and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>Alongside linalool, the oil also contains luteolin, a flavonoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Phytol, a component of the oil, acts as a precursor to vitamin E and exhibits antioxidant activity. Coriandrin, another bioactive constituent, has shown antimicrobial and antifungal properties.</p>
<p>Finally, apigenin, a flavone, contributes to the oil's anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Coriandrum sativum essential oil is primarily derived from the seeds, leaves, and stems of the plant.</p>
<p>The seeds are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their high concentration of essential oils and aromatic compounds. Leaves are also frequently utilized, especially in culinary and medicinal applications for their distinct flavor and therapeutic properties. The stems, while less common, contribute to the overall composition of the oil in some traditional preparations.</p>
<p>Together, these parts provide the complex chemical profile that gives coriander essential oil its distinctive aroma and medicinal benefits.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Coriandrum sativum essential oil can cause skin irritation when applied directly, leading to redness, itching, or a burning sensation.</p>
<p>It may also trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, resulting in hives or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use or high concentrations can lead to phototoxicity, increasing the risk of sunburn or skin damage when exposed to sunlight. Some users may experience headaches or nausea, especially with excessive inhalation or internal use.</p>
<p>It is important to dilute the oil properly and perform a patch test before use to minimize these potential side effects.</p>
