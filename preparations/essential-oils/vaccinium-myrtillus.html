<p>Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil is a concentrated aromatic extract derived from the blueberries of the Vaccinium myrtillus plant, commonly known as the bilberry.</p>
<p>This essential oil is valued in herbalism for its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is often used to support eye health, improve circulation, and alleviate symptoms of minor ailments such as skin irritations or digestive discomfort. In traditional herbal practices, it may also be applied topically to reduce swelling or promote healing of minor wounds.</p>
<p>Due to its potency, it is typically diluted before use in diffusers, topical applications, or oral formulations under professional guidance.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil boosts immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing the body's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>It eases inflammation through its anti-inflammatory compounds that inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. This essential oil reduces blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow throughout the circulatory system. It fights oxidative stress by acting as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that damage cells.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports heart health by reducing cholesterol levels and improving overall cardiovascular function.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil contains anthocyanins, which are powerful antioxidants that contribute to its vibrant color and potential health benefits.</p>
<p>Quercetin, another key constituent, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The presence of amino acids supports the oil's nutritional profile and may enhance its bioavailability. Ellagic acid and gallic acid are also present, both of which are renowned for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive compounds make Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil a valuable resource in natural medicine and skincare.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves and flowers of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part due to their rich content of phenolic compounds and volatile oils. Flowers are also harvested for their subtle floral notes and additional medicinal properties. Roots are occasionally used, but they contribute less to the essential oil's composition compared to leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most significant sources for producing the medicinal essential oil from Vaccinium myrtillus.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vaccinium myrtillus essential oil can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to respiratory issues such as coughing or wheezing if inhaled in large amounts. Some people may experience headaches or dizziness after using the oil, particularly with prolonged exposure. Additionally, it can irritate the eyes if it comes into contact with them.</p>
<p>As with any essential oil, it is important to perform a patch test and consult a healthcare professional before use.</p>
