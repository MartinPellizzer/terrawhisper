The bark, especially from the older trees, is also widely harvested for its aromatic and medicinal properties. The twigs, often used in traditional medicine, contribute to the oil's therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>These parts are typically steam-distilled to extract the essential oil, which is then used in various medicinal and aromatic applications.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum camphora essential oil can cause skin irritation, especially when applied undiluted, leading to redness, itching, or burning sensations.</p>
<p>It may also trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, resulting in hives or respiratory symptoms.
