In modern times, it is widely used in aromatherapy and natural medicine for its calming effects and potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Pimpinella anisum essential oil, start by harvesting fresh anise seeds when they are fully mature and dry.</p>
<p>Next, place the seeds in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality carrier oil such as jojoba or sweet almond oil. Allow the mixture to infuse in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar occasionally to ensure even extraction. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from light and heat to preserve its potency and aroma.</p>

Ingestion of large amounts may result in more severe effects such as liver damage or respiratory distress. Prolonged use might lead to dependency or hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content.</p>
