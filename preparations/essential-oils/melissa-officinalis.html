<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis essential oil relieves stress levels by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system through its soothing properties.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by stimulating the body's natural defenses and reducing inflammation. This oil is also effective in treating anxiety symptoms, as its aromatic compounds help balance mood and reduce feelings of unease. Additionally, it eases insomnia issues by inducing a sense of tranquility and improving sleep quality.</p>
<p>Lastly, Melissa officinalis essential oil heals skin irritations due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis essential oil contains rosmarinic acid, which is known for its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alongside rosmarinic acid, apigenin and luteolin are also present, both contributing to the oil's antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Quercetin, another bioactive compound, provides additional antioxidant and anti-cancer benefits. Chlorogenic acid further enhances the oil's ability to combat oxidative stress and support immune function.</p>
<p>Together, these constituents make Melissa officinalis essential oil a valuable natural resource for various therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves and flowers of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for extraction.</p>
<p>The leaves contain a high concentration of volatile compounds, making them the primary source for the essential oil. Flowers are also frequently used, as they contribute to the oil's aromatic and therapeutic properties. While roots and stems are occasionally used, they are less common and not as effective in producing the characteristic fragrance and medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most valuable parts for creating high-quality Melissa officinalis essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis essential oil can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort if ingested in large amounts. Headaches and dizziness are occasionally reported, particularly with higher concentrations or prolonged use. Respiratory irritation, such as coughing or throat tightness, can occur in sensitive individuals.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with preexisting conditions or during pregnancy.</p>
