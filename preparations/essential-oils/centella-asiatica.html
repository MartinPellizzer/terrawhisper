<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica essential oil improves skin texture by promoting collagen production and enhancing skin elasticity, resulting in a smoother and more radiant complexion.</p>
<p>It protects against oxidation due to its high concentration of antioxidants, which neutralize free radicals and prevent cellular damage. This oil supports wound healing by stimulating the growth of new tissue and reducing inflammation, making it beneficial for skin recovery. Additionally, it boosts brain function by increasing blood flow to the brain and supporting the production of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Finally, it enhances cognitive power by improving mental clarity, focus, and memory retention.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica essential oil contains triterpenoid glycosides, which are known for their wound-healing properties and ability to stimulate collagen synthesis.</p>
<p>Triterpenoid saponins contribute to the oil's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, supporting skin regeneration. Asiatic acid and madecassoside are key triterpene compounds that enhance cellular proliferation and reduce scar formation. These bioactive constituents also exhibit neuroprotective and antimicrobial activities.</p>
<p>Together, they make Centella asiatica essential oil a valuable ingredient in skincare and therapeutic formulations.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica essential oil is primarily derived from the aerial parts of the plant, including the leaves and stems, which are the most commonly used for extraction.</p>
<p>The leaves are the primary source, as they contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as asiatic acid and madecassic acid. The stems are also utilized, especially when the leaves are not available in sufficient quantity. Roots are rarely used in essential oil production due to their lower essential oil content and the preference for above-ground parts.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and stems are the most important parts for creating the medicinal essential oil from Centella asiatica.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica essential oil can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and burning sensations, especially when applied directly to the skin without dilution.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions in some individuals, manifesting as hives or rashes. Prolonged use might result in skin sensitivity or dryness due to its potent nature. In rare cases, it can trigger respiratory issues such as coughing or sneezing when inhaled.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using this oil and consult a healthcare professional if adverse effects occur.</p>
