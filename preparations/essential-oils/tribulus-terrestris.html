alt="Tribulus terrestris essential oil">
<p>Tribulus terrestris essential oil is a concentrated extract derived from the seeds of the Tribulus terrestris plant, commonly known as puncture vine.</p>
<p>This oil is valued in herbalism for its potential to support hormonal balance and enhance vitality. It is often used in aromatherapy and topical applications to promote energy, libido, and overall well-being. The essential oil may also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p>

<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris essential oil is primarily derived from the roots and seeds of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>The roots are often harvested and dried before undergoing steam distillation to extract the essential oil. Seeds are also a key source, particularly because they contain high levels of saponins and other bioactive substances. While leaves and stems are sometimes used, they contribute less to the essential oil's potency compared to the roots and seeds.</p>
<p>Overall, the roots and seeds are the most commonly utilized parts for producing Tribulus terrestris essential oil due to their rich chemical composition.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris essential oil can cause skin irritation, redness, and itching when applied topically, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or eczema in some users. Ingesting the oil can result in gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea and vomiting. Prolonged use may contribute to hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test and consult a healthcare professional before using this essential oil.</p>
