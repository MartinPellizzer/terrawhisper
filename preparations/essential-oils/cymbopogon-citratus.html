<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus essential oil reduces inflammation by containing active compounds like limonene and myrcene, which have potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It also boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing the body's defense mechanisms. The oil can relieve joint pain due to its ability to reduce swelling and ease muscle tension. It eases digestion issues by promoting the secretion of digestive enzymes and reducing gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>
<p>Additionally, it helps lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and improving circulation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus essential oil contains citral, which is the primary compound responsible for its characteristic citrus aroma and various pharmacological activities.</p>
<p>Limonene and d-limonene are also present, contributing to the oil's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Geraniol is another key constituent that exhibits antimicrobial and antifungal effects. Linalool, known for its calming and sedative properties, further enhances the therapeutic value of the oil.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Cymbopogon citratus essential oil a valuable natural product in aromatherapy and pharmaceutical applications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their rich content of citral and other volatile oils. While the roots and stems can also be used, they yield a lower volume of essential oil compared to the leaves. The flowering tops are sometimes included in the distillation process to enhance the oil's fragrance and potency.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most essential and preferred part for producing high-quality Cymbopogon citratus essential oil.</p>
