<p>The roots are particularly valued for their high levels of alkaloids and withanolides, making them a key source for medicinal applications. Leaves are also commonly used, as they contain significant amounts of the same active compounds found in the roots. Both parts are often processed through steam distillation to extract the essential oil.</p>
<p>These components are widely utilized in traditional and modern medicine for their adaptogenic and therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Withania somnifera essential oil can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially when applied directly to the skin without dilution.</p>
