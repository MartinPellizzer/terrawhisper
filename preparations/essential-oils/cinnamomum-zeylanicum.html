<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil reduces blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving circulation, which helps lower systemic vascular resistance.</p>
<p>It also treats dental infections due to its potent antimicrobial properties that combat bacteria responsible for gum disease and tooth decay. The oil reduces inflammation through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, which can alleviate symptoms in conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, it relaxes stress and anxiety by interacting with the central nervous system to promote calmness and emotional balance.</p>
<p>Finally, by supporting cardiovascular health, it reduces the risk of heart disease, making it a valuable natural remedy for overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil contains cinnamaldehyde, which is the primary active compound responsible for its characteristic aroma and various pharmacological properties.</p>
<p>In addition to cinnamaldehyde, the oil also contains sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Polysaccharides present in the oil may enhance its immune-modulating properties and support skin health. Cinnamic acid, another key constituent, exhibits antioxidant and antifungal activities.</p>
<p>Lastly, quercetin, a flavonoid found in the oil, contributes to its anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their high concentration of essential oils.</p>
<p>The leaves contain the majority of the aromatic compounds responsible for the oil's distinctive scent and medicinal properties. While the bark is also used in some traditional preparations, it is less common compared to the leaves. The roots of the plant are occasionally utilized, but they contribute less to the essential oil production than the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the primary source for extracting Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and burning sensations, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions in some individuals, such as hives or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use or high concentrations can result in photosensitivity, increasing the risk of sunburn. Ingestion of the oil can be toxic, causing nausea, vomiting, or more severe systemic effects.</p>
<p>It is important to dilute the oil properly and perform a patch test before use.</p>
