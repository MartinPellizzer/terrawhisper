<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Pelargonium graveolens essential oil relaxes muscle tension by promoting relaxation of the skeletal muscles through its calming properties.</p>
<p>It accelerates wound healing due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, which support tissue regeneration. This essential oil also boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing overall body defense mechanisms. Additionally, it helps relax the nervous system, reducing stress and anxiety by interacting with the body's stress response pathways.</p>
<p>Furthermore, its antioxidant properties help prevent cell damage by neutralizing free radicals and protecting cellular structures from oxidative stress.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Pelargonium graveolens essential oil contains linalool, which is known for its calming and sedative effects, making it widely used in aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Linalyl acetate contributes to the oil's fragrance and also exhibits antimicrobial properties. Rosmarinic acid is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound found in the oil. Caffeic acid provides additional antioxidant benefits and may support immune function.</p>
<p>Quercetin, a flavonoid, enhances the oil's antioxidant profile and may help in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Pelargonium graveolens essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their rich content of volatile oils such as limonene and geraniol. While the roots and stems can also be used, they yield less essential oil and are less frequently employed in commercial production. The flowers are occasionally used, but their contribution to the overall oil composition is minimal compared to the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most important and widely utilized part of the Pelargonium graveolens plant for medicinal essential oil production.</p>
