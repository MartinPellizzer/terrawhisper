The oil has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce swelling and pain in conditions like arthritis or muscle inflammation.

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Anethum graveolens essential oil contains furanocoumarins, which are phototoxic compounds known for their ability to enhance the skin's sensitivity to sunlight.</p>
<p>Pinene, a monoterpene, contributes to the oil's characteristic fresh and pine-like aroma and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. Sabinene, another monoterpene, is associated with antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Bornyl acetate is a sesquiterpene ester that imparts a woody and spicy scent and is valued for its calming effects.</p>
<p>Carvone, a cyclic monoterpene ketone, is responsible for the oil's distinctive peppery and minty aroma and has been studied for its potential antispasmodic and digestive benefits.</p>

<p>The leaves contain a high concentration of volatile compounds that contribute to the essential oil's aromatic and therapeutic properties. While the roots are less frequently used, they can also be harvested for their medicinal compounds in certain traditional practices. The seeds, often referred to as cumin, are particularly valued for their essential oil content, which is rich in compounds like limonene and cineole.</p>
