<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum essential oil ease digestion issues by stimulating the digestive system and reducing bloating and gas.</p>
<p>It also boosts the immune system due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This essential oil has been shown to lower cholesterol levels by improving lipid metabolism and reducing bad cholesterol. Additionally, it helps reduce anxiety levels through its calming and mood-enhancing effects.</p>
<p>Lastly, it can lower blood pressure by promoting relaxation and improving circulation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum essential oil contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>In addition to flavonoids, the oil comprises volatile oils, contributing to its aromatic profile and therapeutic effects. Saponins are also present, offering potential antimicrobial and emulsifying benefits. Limonene, a key monoterpene, is responsible for the oil's characteristic citrus scent and may have anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>Fatty acids contribute to the oil's stability and enhance its bioavailability when used in formulations.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum essential oil is primarily derived from the dried, matured berries of the plant, which are the fruiting bodies containing the aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>The seeds themselves are the main source of the essential oil, as they contain the highest concentration of volatile compounds. While the leaves and stems may contribute to the overall aroma, they are not the primary parts used for extraction. The roots and other vegetative parts are generally not utilized in the production of medicinal essential oil.</p>
<p>The berries are typically harvested when fully ripe, ensuring the maximum potency of the essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum essential oil can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to respiratory symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath in sensitive people. Prolonged use or high concentrations can result in headaches or nausea. Ingestion of the oil can be toxic and should be avoided unless under professional guidance.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before use and consult a healthcare provider if adverse effects occur.</p>
