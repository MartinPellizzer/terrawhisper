<p>Cassia auriculata essential oil is a concentrated aromatic extract derived from the flowers of the Cassia auriculata plant, commonly known as the golden shower tree.</p>
<p>This oil is valued in herbalism for its potential anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. It is often used in aromatherapy to support respiratory health and to help alleviate symptoms of colds and coughs. Additionally, it may be applied topically to soothe skin irritations and promote wound healing.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it is also used to aid digestion and reduce stress.</p>

<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves, flowers, and bark of the plant, with the leaves being the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The flowers are also frequently utilized because they contribute a distinct floral aroma and contain valuable volatile oils. The bark, while less common, is sometimes used for its medicinal properties and unique chemical composition. Roots are rarely used in essential oil extraction due to their lower yield and less potent aromatic profile.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most preferred parts for producing Cassia auriculata essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata essential oil can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and burning sensations, especially when applied directly without dilution.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to related compounds found in the oil. Some users may experience headaches or dizziness due to its strong aromatic properties. Prolonged use can result in skin dryness or sensitivity, requiring careful monitoring.</p>
<p>As with any essential oil, it is advisable to perform a patch test before broader application.</p>
