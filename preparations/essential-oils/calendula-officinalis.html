<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis essential oil is primarily derived from the flowers of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>The petals are the most commonly used part for extraction, as they provide the majority of the essential oil's therapeutic properties. While leaves and stems can also be used, they yield a lower volume of oil compared to the flowers. Roots are rarely used in essential oil production due to their minimal contribution to the oil's composition.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically harvested at full bloom to ensure maximum potency and aroma.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis essential oil can cause skin irritation, redness, and itching in some individuals, especially when applied directly to the skin without dilution.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, such as hives or contact dermatitis, in people sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family. Some users may experience a burning or stinging sensation upon application, which can be uncomfortable. In rare cases, it may trigger respiratory symptoms like coughing or wheezing, particularly in those with asthma.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using this oil to minimize the risk of adverse effects.</p>
