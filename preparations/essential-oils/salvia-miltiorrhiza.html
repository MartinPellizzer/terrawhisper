<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Salvia miltiorrhiza essential oil, first gather fresh or dried Salvia miltiorrhiza leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Next, place the plant material in a glass jar and cover it completely with a high-quality carrier oil, such as jojoba or sweet almond oil. Let the mixture infuse in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from light and heat to preserve its potency.</p>
