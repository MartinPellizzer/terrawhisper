Then, cover the leaves with a high-quality carrier oil, such as jojoba or coconut oil, and let the mixture infuse for 4 to 6 weeks in a cool, dark place. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or coffee filter to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from light and heat to preserve its potency.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Aloe barbadensis essential oil may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in high concentrations.</p>

In rare cases, it may interact with medications, affecting their absorption or metabolism in the body.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this essential oil, especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers, or those with existing medical conditions.</p>
