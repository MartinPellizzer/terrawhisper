<p>Overall, the roots and seeds are the most significant parts in the production of Angelica archangelica essential oil.</p>

<p>It may also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea or vomiting if ingested. Some individuals may experience allergic reactions, including hives or respiratory issues. Prolonged use can result in hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content.</p>
