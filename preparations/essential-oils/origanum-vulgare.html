<p>Historically, it was used to combat digestive issues, respiratory infections, and as a natural preservative in food and medicine. In traditional herbalism, it was also employed to relieve muscle pain, reduce inflammation, and promote mental clarity. Modern applications include its use in aromatherapy for stress relief, as an antiseptic, and in skincare for its antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>Today, it continues to be a popular essential oil in both alternative and complementary medicine practices.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It is commonly used to support respiratory health by helping to relieve symptoms of colds, coughs, and bronchitis. The oil may also aid in digestion by reducing bloating and promoting healthy gut function. Its calming effects can help reduce stress and anxiety, making it useful in aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been studied for its potential to combat harmful bacteria and fungi, making it a valuable natural remedy.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Geraniol adds to its aromatic profile and may aid in digestion and respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Origanum vulgare essential oil, first gather fresh or dried oregano leaves, ensuring they are clean and free of contaminants.</p>
<p>Next, place the leaves in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality carrier oil, such as olive oil or jojoba oil. Allow the mixture to infuse for 4 to 6 weeks in a cool, dark place, shaking the jar gently every few days to promote extraction. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.</p>

Individuals with asthma or respiratory conditions should use it cautiously, as it may trigger breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this essential oil, particularly during pregnancy or while taking medications.</p>
