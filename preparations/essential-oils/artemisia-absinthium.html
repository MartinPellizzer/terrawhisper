<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil cures malaria quickly due to its potent antimalarial properties that target the Plasmodium parasite.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulating immune responses. This essential oil relieves digestive issues by stimulating bile production and aiding in the digestion of fats. It kills bacterial infections through its antimicrobial compounds that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it improves liver function by promoting detoxification processes and protecting liver cells from damage.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil contains thujone, a major monoterpene that contributes to its distinctive aroma and is known for its psychoactive properties.</p>
<p>Alongside thujone, the oil contains various volatile oils and volatile terpenes, which are responsible for its complex fragrance profile and therapeutic effects. Absinthin, a bitter sesquiterpene lactone, is also present and contributes to the oil's bitterness and potential medicinal uses. Coumarins, another group of compounds found in the oil, are known for their aromatic properties and may have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>These bioactive constituents collectively influence the oil's pharmacological and sensory characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves and flowering tops of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves, in particular, are the most commonly used part due to their rich content of essential oils like thujone and limonene. The flowering tops, which include both the flowers and the upper parts of the stems, also contribute significantly to the oil's composition. While the roots are less frequently used, they do contain some volatile compounds that may be extracted in smaller quantities.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowering tops are the most important parts for producing the medicinal essential oil of Artemisia absinthium.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Artemisia absinthium essential oil can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to nausea or digestive discomfort if ingested, as it is not considered safe for internal use. Prolonged use can result in headaches or dizziness due to its potent chemical composition. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, potentially increasing their effects or causing adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Because of these risks, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this essential oil.</p>
