Traditional uses also included treating respiratory conditions and skin ailments, with the oil often applied topically or inhaled for its aromatic properties. In modern times, the essential oil is widely used in aromatherapy and supplements to support brain health, reduce anxiety, and promote blood flow.</p>
<p>Scientific studies continue to explore its potential benefits, though more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy.</p>

<p>However, it should be used with caution and under professional guidance due to its potent nature.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

Let the mixture steep in a dark, cool place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days to promote extraction. After the steeping period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from light and heat to preserve its potency and extend its shelf life.</p>
