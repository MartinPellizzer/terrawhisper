<p>Ginkgo biloba essential oil is a concentrated extract derived from the leaves of the ginkgo tree, known for its potent aromatic and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in herbalism to enhance cognitive function, improve circulation, and support mental clarity. The oil is often diffused to promote focus and reduce stress, or applied topically to alleviate symptoms of poor circulation. It is valued for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, making it a popular choice in aromatherapy and natural medicine.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution and diluted properly due to its strong nature.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba essential oil reduce inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.</p>
<p>It also improves memory by enhancing cognitive function and increasing blood flow to the brain. The oil helps regulate blood pressure through its vasodilating properties, promoting cardiovascular health. Additionally, it improves circulation by stimulating blood vessel dilation and reducing clot formation.</p>
<p>Lastly, Ginkgo biloba essential oil boosts antioxidant activity, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba essential oil contains phytosterols, which are plant-derived compounds that may support cardiovascular health and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Among its key bioactive constituents are ginkgolides, which are unique terpene lactones known for their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids, another major component, contribute to the oil's antioxidant capacity and may enhance cognitive function. Bilobalide, a diterpene, is recognized for its potential to improve memory and protect brain cells from oxidative damage.</p>
<p>Biflavonoids, a rare class of compounds found in Ginkgo biloba, further support the oil's therapeutic effects by enhancing circulation and reducing oxidative stress.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the tree, which contain high concentrations of bioactive compounds like flavonoids and terpenes.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their rich phytochemical profile and traditional medicinal significance. While the roots and bark are also used in some preparations, they are less common in commercial essential oil production. The leaves are typically harvested in the fall when their chemical composition is at its peak.</p>
<p>This makes the leaves the most essential and widely utilized part of the Ginkgo biloba plant for creating medicinal essential oils.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba essential oil can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied topically.</p>
<p>It may also lead to headaches or dizziness, particularly with higher concentrations or prolonged use. Some users report gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea or upset stomach, when ingesting the oil. Additionally, it can interact with certain medications, increasing the risk of bleeding or affecting blood pressure.</p>
<p>As with any essential oil, it is important to dilute it properly and consult a healthcare professional before use.</p>
