<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>

While the flowers may also contribute to the essential oil, they are less frequently utilized compared to the leaves. The roots and stems are generally not used for essential oil production, as they contain fewer aromatic compounds.</p>
