<p>Today, it is also explored for its potential in natural pest control and as a flavoring agent in food products.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Additionally, its antifungal properties make it useful in treating skin infections and other fungal-related conditions.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cassia angustifolia essential oil, first gather fresh or dried Cassia angustifolia leaves, which are the primary source of the oil.</p>
<p>Next, place the leaves in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality carrier oil, such as jojoba or coconut oil. Allow the mixture to infuse in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days to ensure even extraction. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from direct sunlight to preserve its potency and extend its shelf life.</p>
