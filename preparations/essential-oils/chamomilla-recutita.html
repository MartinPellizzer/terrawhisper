<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita essential oil reduces inflammation by containing compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene, which have potent anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It calms anxiety through its soothing aroma, which can help lower stress hormones and promote emotional balance. This oil eases digestion by relaxing the gastrointestinal tract and reducing spasms, making it beneficial for digestive discomfort. It also relaxes muscles by acting as a natural sedative, helping to alleviate muscle tension and pain.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chamomilla recutita essential oil treats allergies by reducing histamine response and supporting the bodyâ€™s immune system.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita essential oil contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Among these, apigenin is a prominent flavone that contributes to the oil's therapeutic effects. The oil also contains sesquiterpenes, which are responsible for its characteristic aroma and have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Furanocoumarins, although present in smaller amounts, can enhance the phototoxicity of certain compounds when exposed to light.</p>
<p>Additionally, luteolin, another flavonoid, exhibits strong antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, further supporting the oil's medicinal value.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita essential oil is primarily derived from the flowers of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>The flowers are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their rich content of chamazulene and other beneficial phytochemicals. While the leaves and stems may also be used in some preparations, they contribute less to the essential oil's potency compared to the flowers. The roots of Chamomilla recutita are rarely used in essential oil production, as they contain minimal aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the flowers remain the most critical and widely utilized part of the plant for creating this valued medicinal essential oil.</p>
