<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Serenoa repens essential oil, first gather fresh or dried Serenoa repens leaves, commonly known as saw palmetto.</p>
<p>Next, place the leaves in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil. Allow the mixture to infuse in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from direct sunlight to preserve its potency and extend its shelf life.</p>

<p>It can also cause skin irritation or allergic reactions when applied topically, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as some components of the oil are metabolized by the liver. There is limited research on its long-term effects, so caution is advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women and children.</p>
<p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using this essential oil, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
