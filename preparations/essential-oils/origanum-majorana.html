<p>Lastly, it fights bacterial infections due to its potent antimicrobial properties, making it a valuable natural remedy for various infections.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Origanum majorana essential oil contains carvacrol, which is the primary bioactive compound known for its potent antimicrobial and antifungal properties.</p>
<p>Thymol, another key constituent, complements carvacrol by enhancing its therapeutic effects, particularly in combating bacterial infections. Linalool contributes to the oil's calming and anti-inflammatory properties, making it beneficial for respiratory and skin conditions. Gamma-terpinene adds to the oil's antioxidant and antiseptic qualities, supporting its use in natural remedies.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Origanum majorana essential oil is primarily derived from the leaves of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their rich content of volatile oils like carvacrol and thymol. While the stems and flowers may also contribute to the essential oil, they are less frequently used compared to the leaves. The roots of Origanum majorana are rarely utilized in essential oil production because they contain fewer aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most significant and preferred part for creating this valuable medicinal essential oil.</p>
