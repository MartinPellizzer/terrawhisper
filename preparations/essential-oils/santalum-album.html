<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Santalum album essential oil calms anxiety by promoting relaxation and reducing mental tension through its calming aromatic properties.</p>
<p>It soothes the skin by helping to alleviate irritation and inflammation, making it beneficial for various skin conditions. This oil also reduces stress by supporting a sense of tranquility and balance within the body. Additionally, it can help heal burns by promoting skin regeneration and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Lastly, Santalum album essential oil relieves pain by acting as a natural analgesic, providing relief for minor aches and discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Santalum album essential oil contains β-santalol, which is the primary constituent and contributes significantly to its distinctive woody and amber scent.</p>
<p>Alongside β-santalol, α-santalol is also present and works synergistically to enhance the oil's aromatic profile and therapeutic properties. Phenylethanoid glycosides are another key component, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Santalbic acid, a unique compound found in the oil, exhibits antimicrobial and skin-soothing properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, triterpenoids contribute to the oil's overall bioactivity, offering potential benefits in skin health and immune support.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Santalum album essential oil is primarily derived from the heartwood of the tree, which contains the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The roots are also used, as they contain significant amounts of the oil, though they are less common than the heartwood. The leaves of the Santalum album plant are occasionally utilized, but they yield a lower quantity of essential oil compared to other parts. The bark may be used in some traditional practices, but it is not as prominent as the heartwood or roots in modern extraction methods.</p>
<p>Overall, the heartwood and roots are the most valued and widely used parts for producing medicinal essential oil from Santalum album.</p>
