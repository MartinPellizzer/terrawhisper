<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Santalum album essential oil, first gather high-quality sandalwood wood, preferably from the heart of the tree, as it contains the highest concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Next, place the wood in a still and add a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil, to help extract the essential oil through steam distillation. Heat the mixture gently to release the volatile compounds, allowing the steam to carry the aromatic molecules into a condensation coil. Collect the essential oil as it drips into a collection vessel, ensuring it is separated from the water and carrier oil.</p>
<p>Finally, store the essential oil in a dark, cool place in a tightly sealed glass container to preserve its potency and aroma.</p>

However, prolonged use or high concentrations can cause respiratory issues, particularly in people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. The oil may also interact with certain medications, so it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p>
<p>Possible side effects include headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light in some cases.</p>
