<p>Today, scientific research continues to explore its potential in treating conditions such as headaches, digestive issues, and skin disorders.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Next, place the cloves in a glass jar and cover them completely with a high-quality carrier oil, such as fractionated coconut oil or jojoba oil. Let the mixture infuse in a cool, dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar gently every few days to promote extraction. After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the solid clove particles.</p>
<p>Store the essential oil in a dark glass bottle away from light and heat to preserve its potency and shelf life.</p>
