<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis essential oil reduces inflammation by containing compounds that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body, making it beneficial for conditions like arthritis and skin irritations.</p>
<p>It also boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells, enhancing the body's defense against infections. The oil can relieve headaches and ease pain due to its analgesic and antispasmodic properties, which help soothe muscle tension and migraines. Additionally, it reduces stress by promoting relaxation and balancing the nervous system, which can improve overall mental well-being.</p>
<p>These combined health benefits make Angelica sinensis essential oil a valuable natural remedy for various ailments.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis essential oil contains ligustilide, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Butylphthalide contributes to the oil's ability to improve blood circulation and reduce oxidative stress. Quercetin, a flavonoid, provides antioxidant and anti-cancer benefits. Ursolic acid is recognized for its potential in reducing inflammation and supporting skin health.</p>
<p>Beta-sitosterol helps in lowering cholesterol levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects as well.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis essential oil is primarily derived from the roots of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The roots contain high concentrations of bioactive compounds such as ligustilide and藁本内酯, making them the primary source for extraction. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used, they contribute less to the essential oil's potency compared to the roots. The root is harvested during specific seasons to maximize its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its rich composition, the root remains the most valued part in the production of Angelica sinensis essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis essential oil can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or hives, especially in those with sensitivities. Prolonged use might result in hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content. Headaches and dizziness are occasionally reported as side effects.</p>
