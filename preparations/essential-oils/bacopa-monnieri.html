<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>

Saponins further support the oil's therapeutic potential by promoting detoxification and improving cellular function.</p>

<p>The leaves are typically harvested during the plant's flowering stage to maximize their medicinal properties. While the roots are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common in essential oil production due to lower potency. The aerial parts, including stems and flowers, may contribute minor amounts to the essential oil but are not the primary source.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most crucial part of Bacopa monnieri for extracting high-quality medicinal essential oil.</p>
