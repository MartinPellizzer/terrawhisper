<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus essential oil regulates menstrual cycles by influencing hormonal pathways, particularly through its impact on luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels.</p>
<p>It also improves libido levels by enhancing estrogen and testosterone balance, which can boost sexual desire and overall well-being. This oil alleviates infertility by supporting reproductive health and improving ovarian function in women. Additionally, it supports hormone balance by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reducing cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, it reduces androgen excess, making it beneficial for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hormonal acne.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus essential oil contains diterpenes, which are known for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Among the bioactive compounds, vitexicarpin stands out as a key component with potent antispasmodic and antifungal effects. Agnuside, a unique iridoid glycoside, contributes to the oil's ability to regulate hormonal balance. Flavonoids present in the oil exhibit antioxidant and neuroprotective activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, phenolic acids provide further antioxidant support, enhancing the overall therapeutic potential of the essential oil.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus essential oil is primarily derived from the flowers of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for extraction due to their high concentration of aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The flowers are harvested at the peak of their bloom to ensure maximum potency and fragrance. While other parts like leaves and roots may be used in some traditional preparations, they are not as prevalent in commercial essential oil production. The essential oil extracted from the flowers is known for its complex blend of sesquiterpenes and esters, contributing to its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>This makes the flowers the most significant and widely utilized part of the Vitex agnus-castus plant in the creation of medicinal essential oils.</p>
