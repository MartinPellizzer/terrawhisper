<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia essential oil relieve anxiety symptoms by promoting a calming effect on the nervous system through its soothing aroma.</p>
<p>It improves sleep quality by helping to regulate the sleep-wake cycle and reduce nighttime disturbances. This essential oil promotes a relaxation response by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps lower heart rate and ease tension. It reduces stress levels by interacting with neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA, which are key in mood regulation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lavandula angustifolia has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation levels in the body, supporting overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia essential oil contains linalyl acetate, which is a major ester contributing to its characteristic floral and sweet aroma.</p>
<p>Linalool, another key constituent, is known for its calming and sedative effects, making it widely used in aromatherapy. The oil also contains various fatty acids, such as linoleic and palmitic acid, which may support skin health and provide emollient properties. Phenolic acids like rosmarinic acid are present and contribute to the oil's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the oil contains minerals such as potassium and magnesium, which may enhance its therapeutic potential when used in skincare or medicinal applications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia essential oil is primarily derived from the flowering tops of the plant, which include the flowers and the upper parts of the stems.</p>
<p>The flowers are the main source of the aromatic compounds that give lavender its distinctive scent and therapeutic properties. While the leaves can also be used to produce essential oil, they are typically harvested alongside the flowers for a more concentrated yield. The roots of Lavandula angustifolia are rarely used in essential oil extraction due to their lower concentration of volatile compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the most valuable parts for medicinal essential oil are the flowers and upper stems, which are rich in linalool and linalyl acetate.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia essential oil can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, especially when applied undiluted.</p>
<p>It may also lead to phototoxicity if exposed to sunlight, causing skin sensitivity. Common side effects include dryness, redness, and itching at the application site. In rare cases, it may trigger respiratory symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Always perform a patch test and consult a healthcare professional before use, particularly for those with sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p>
