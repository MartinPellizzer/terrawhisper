<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata essential oil lowers blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and reducing stress-induced hypertension.</p>
<p>It eases arthritis pain through its anti-inflammatory properties that target joint inflammation and stiffness. The oil also fights osteoarthritis pain by inhibiting enzymes that contribute to cartilage degradation. Additionally, it reduces inflammation throughout the body, supporting overall immune health and cellular function.</p>
<p>Lastly, Boswellia serrata essential oil fights anxiety attacks by modulating neurotransmitter activity and calming the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata essential oil contains boswellic acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Among these, acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid is particularly effective in inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in inflammation. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid contribute to the oil's antioxidant activity, helping to neutralize free radicals. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in the oil, further enhances its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Boswellia serrata essential oil a valuable natural remedy for various inflammatory conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Boswella serrata essential oil is primarily derived from the resinous sap of its bark, which is collected from the tree's trunk and branches.</p>
<p>The most commonly used part of the plant for extraction is the inner bark, known as the gum or frankincense resin. This resin is obtained through a process called tapping, where the bark is carefully cut to allow the sap to flow. The leaves and roots of Boswellia serrata are not typically used for essential oil production, as they contain lower concentrations of the active compounds.</p>
<p>Instead, the resin from the bark is the main source of the plant's medicinal properties and aromatic compounds.</p>
