<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia lozenge has been used to support immune function and alleviate symptoms of colds and respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Historically, Native American tribes such as the Lakota and Pawnee used echinacea for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, often preparing it as a tea or applying it topically. In traditional medicine, it was also used to treat wounds, sore throats, and skin conditions. Modern scientific research suggests that echinacea may help reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms, though results are mixed.</p>
<p>Today, echinacea angustifolia lozenge is commonly used as a complementary remedy to boost immunity and soothe throat irritation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia lozenge has health benefits such as boosting the immune system and reducing the duration of cold symptoms.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to support the body's natural defenses against viral infections. The lozenge form allows for easy consumption and can provide localized relief for sore throats. It may also help alleviate symptoms like coughing and congestion associated with respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with allergies or chronic conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia lozenge active constituents include alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, and polysaccharides.</p>
<p>These compounds are believed to support immune function by enhancing the activity of white blood cells. Alkamides may help reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response. Caffeic acid derivatives have antioxidant properties that may protect cells from oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides are thought to stimulate the production of cytokines, which are important in fighting infections.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Echinacea angustifolia lozenge, first gather dried Echinacea angustifolia root and grind it into a fine powder.</p>
<p>Next, combine the powder with a small amount of honey or a sugar-free sweetener to create a thick paste. Then, shape the mixture into small lozenges using a mold or by hand. Allow the lozenges to dry completely in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>Finally, store the lozenges in an airtight container to preserve their potency and freshness.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal upset, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions, including rash, itching, or difficulty breathing, particularly in those with a history of allergies or asthma. Some people may experience dizziness or fatigue as side effects, though these are less common. Long-term use may increase the risk of liver toxicity, although this is rare.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Echinacea angustifolia lozenge, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p>
