<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba lozenge has been used to enhance cognitive function and improve blood circulation for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, the Ginkgo biloba tree, known as the "maiden's hair tree," was revered in Chinese medicine for its ability to sharpen the mind and promote longevity. Traditional uses included treating memory loss, headaches, and circulatory disorders, often prepared as teas or extracts. In modern times, the lozenge form has gained popularity for its convenience and potential to support mental clarity and focus, particularly among students and professionals.</p>
<p>Today, it is commonly used as a dietary supplement to address age-related cognitive decline and enhance overall brain health.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba lozenge has health benefits such as improving cognitive function, enhancing memory, and promoting better blood circulation.</p>
<p>It is often used to support brain health and may help in reducing symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The lozenge form allows for easier absorption of the active compounds, such as flavonoids and terpene lactones, which are known for their antioxidant properties. It may also help in reducing mental fatigue and improving focus, making it beneficial for students and professionals.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can support overall cardiovascular health by dilating blood vessels and improving blood flow.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba lozenge active constituents include flavonoids and terpenoids, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Flavonoids act as antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals in the body. Terpenoids, particularly ginkgolides and bilobalide, are known for their ability to improve blood flow and support cognitive function. These compounds may also have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba lozenge is often used to support memory, concentration, and overall brain health.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Ginkgo biloba lozenge, first gather fresh or dried Ginkgo biloba leaves and clean them thoroughly.</p>
<p>Next, grind the leaves into a fine powder using a blender or food processor. Then, mix the powdered leaves with a binding agent such as honey or glycerin to form a paste. Shape the mixture into small lozenges using a mold or by hand.</p>
<p>Finally, allow the lozenges to dry completely in a cool, dark place before storing them in an airtight container.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its active compounds stimulating digestive processes.</p>
<p>It can also cause headaches or dizziness in some individuals, possibly due to its effect on blood flow and neurotransmitter activity. The lozenge may interact with blood-thinning medications, increasing the risk of bleeding. Long-term use might lead to allergic reactions, especially in people sensitive to the ginkgo tree's pollen.</p>
<p>Additionally, some users may experience skin irritation or rashes from prolonged contact with the preparation.</p>
