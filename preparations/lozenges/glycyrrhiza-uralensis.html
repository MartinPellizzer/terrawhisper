<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>This herbal preparation is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of coughs, colds, and throat irritation.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Glycyrrhiza uralensis lozenge, begin by gathering dried Glycyrrhiza uralensis root, which is the primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Next, grind the root into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Then, mix the powdered root with a small amount of honey or a sugar-free sweetener to create a thick paste. Shape the mixture into small, round lozenges using a mold or by hand.</p>
