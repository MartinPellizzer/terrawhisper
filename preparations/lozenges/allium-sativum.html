<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Allium sativum lozenge has been used to treat respiratory and oral health issues for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In modern times, it is commonly used as a natural remedy for sore throat, cough, and bad breath due to its ability to kill bacteria in the mouth. Its active compound, allicin, is believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Today, it is also being studied for its potential benefits in boosting the immune system and reducing the risk of certain infections.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Allium sativum lozenge has health benefits such as supporting respiratory health, reducing inflammation, and enhancing immune function.</p>
<p>These lozenges are made from garlic, which is known for its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. They can help alleviate symptoms of colds and sore throats by fighting off infections. The active compounds in garlic, such as allicin, contribute to their therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Regular use of Allium sativum lozenge may promote overall wellness and support the body's natural defenses.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Allium sativum lozenge active constituents include allicin, sulfur compounds, flavonoids, and various vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Allicin is the primary bioactive compound responsible for the garlic's characteristic odor and many of its therapeutic effects.

<p>Regular use of Allium sativum lozenges may also aid in reducing coughing and improving oral hygiene.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Allium sativum lozenge, begin by crushing fresh garlic cloves into a fine paste.</p>
<p>Next, mix the garlic paste with a small amount of honey or a sugar-free sweetener to create a thick, sticky mixture. Then, add a binding agent such as cornstarch or gelatin to help hold the lozenge together. Shape the mixture into small, manageable pieces and let them dry in a cool, dark place for several days.</p>
<p>Finally, store the lozenges in an airtight container to preserve their potency and flavor.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Allium sativum lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including heartburn, nausea, and a burning sensation in the throat.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to garlic, such as skin rashes or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use may interact with blood-thinning medications, increasing the risk of bleeding. Some users may experience halitosis or bad breath due to the strong garlic odor.</p>
<p>Additionally, excessive consumption could potentially affect liver function, though this is rare.</p>
