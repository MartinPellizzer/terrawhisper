<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum lozenge has been used to soothe sore throats and treat respiratory ailments for centuries in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Originating from ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic practices, it was valued for its warming properties and ability to enhance circulation. Historically, it was also used to improve digestion and promote mental clarity. In modern times, it is commonly found in herbal remedies for colds, coughs, and as a natural flavoring agent.</p>
<p>Today, it is also appreciated for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum lozenge has health benefits such as improving oral hygiene, reducing inflammation, and supporting respiratory health.</p>
<p>The active compounds in cinnamon, like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties that help combat oral infections. Regular use of these lozenges can soothe sore throats and reduce symptoms of colds and coughs. Additionally, they may aid in digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation is also believed to have antioxidant effects that contribute to overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum lozenge active constituents include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and essential oils rich in eugenol and linalool.</p>
<p>These compounds contribute to the lozenge's characteristic aroma and flavor. Cinnamaldehyde is known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help soothe sore throats and reduce oral infections. The essential oils may also provide a warming sensation that can enhance circulation in the mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Overall, these active constituents support respiratory and oral health by combating pathogens and reducing inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cinnamomum verum lozenge, first gather 100 grams of cinnamon bark, 50 grams of honey, and 50 grams of powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Next, combine the cinnamon bark with the honey and powdered sugar in a saucepan, then simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the mixture thickens. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then pour it into a mold or a lined tray. Once cooled and hardened, cut the lozenges into individual pieces and store them in an airtight container.</p>
<p>These lozenges can be used to soothe sore throats and promote respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, especially when taken in high doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to cinnamon, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use may increase the risk of liver damage due to the presence of coumarin, a compound found in cinnamon. In some cases, it may interact with medications such as blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women and those with chronic health conditions.</p>
