<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Echinacea purpurea lozenge has been used to support immune function and alleviate symptoms of colds and respiratory infections.</p>

Traditionally, it was prepared as a tea or tincture, but modern formulations now include lozenges for easier consumption and targeted relief. Today, echinacea lozenges are widely used as a natural remedy to reduce the duration and severity of colds.</p>
<p>Scientific studies suggest that echinacea may stimulate the immune system, though results can vary depending on the specific species and preparation method.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Next, grind them into a fine powder and mix with a small amount of honey or a sweetener of your choice. Then, add a binding agent such as cornstarch or gum arabic to help form the lozenge. Shape the mixture into small tablets or use a lozenge mold.</p>
<p>Finally, allow the lozenges to dry completely in a cool, dark place before storing them in an airtight container.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Echinacea purpurea lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in some individuals.</p>
