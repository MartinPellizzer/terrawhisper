<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis lozenge has been used to soothe sore throats and reduce inflammation in the mouth and throat for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, often prepared by herbalists and used in home remedies. In traditional European and Ayurvedic practices, calendula was also applied externally to treat skin conditions, though the lozenge form was more commonly used for internal ailments. Modern applications include its use in natural throat lozenges to alleviate symptoms of colds and sore throats, supported by its antioxidant and mild antiseptic effects.</p>
<p>Today, it remains a popular choice in herbal medicine for its gentle yet effective therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It contains natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help combat infections and irritation in the mouth. The lozenges are often used to relieve symptoms of colds, coughs, and minor oral infections. They may also support gum health and reduce the risk of dental issues.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation is a gentle and effective option for those seeking natural remedies for oral discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis lozenge active constituents include flavonoids, triterpenes, and carotenoids, which contribute to its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>These compounds possess anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects, making the lozenge beneficial for oral health.

<p>Overall, these active constituents make Calendula officinalis lozenges a valuable herbal preparation for soothing sore throats and promoting oral hygiene.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Calendula officinalis lozenge, start by harvesting fresh or dried Calendula flowers, then grind them into a fine powder.</p>
<p>Next, mix the powder with a binding agent such as honey or glycerin to create a paste. Shape the mixture into small lozenges using a mold or by hand, and allow them to dry in a cool, dark place for several days. Once dried, store the lozenges in an airtight container to preserve their potency.</p>
<p>These lozenges are traditionally used for their soothing properties, particularly for sore throats and minor mouth irritations.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>

<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family, including ragweed, chrysanthemums, and daisies. Prolonged use may result in skin irritation or oral mucosa inflammation due to its active compounds. While generally considered safe for short-term use, it should be avoided by those with known allergies to the plant.</p>
<p>Always consult a healthcare provider before using calendula lozenges, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
