<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum lozenge active constituents include cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and essential oils rich in phenolic compounds.</p>
<p>These components contribute to the lozenge's antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Cinnamaldehyde is particularly noted for its ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi. The essential oils also provide a soothing effect on the oral cavity, making it beneficial for sore throats and oral infections.</p>
<p>Overall, these active constituents support respiratory and digestive health when used as part of a holistic wellness approach.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cinnamomum zeylanicum lozenge, first gather the necessary ingredients: 100 grams of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon) bark, 200 grams of honey, 50 grams of powdered gum arabic, and 50 grams of glucose syrup.</p>
<p>Next, grind the cinnamon bark into a fine powder and mix it with the powdered gum arabic. In a saucepan, heat the honey and glucose syrup over low heat until they become a thick, syrupy consistency. Then, add the cinnamon-gum mixture to the syrup and stir continuously until well combined.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the mixture into molds and allow it to cool and harden before removing the lozenges.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain, especially when taken in high doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to cinnamon, such as skin rashes or respiratory issues. Long-term use may interfere with blood sugar levels, making it potentially risky for people with diabetes. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for prolonged periods or in combination with other treatments.</p>
