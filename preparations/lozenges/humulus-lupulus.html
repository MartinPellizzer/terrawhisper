<p>Historically, it was a key component in traditional herbal medicine, particularly in European cultures, where it was valued for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In traditional use, the lozenge form allowed for direct application to the throat, enhancing its effectiveness in reducing irritation and coughing. Modern applications continue to focus on its ability to relieve throat discomfort, with many herbal remedies and over-the-counter products incorporating it for its soothing effects.</p>
<p>Today, it is also being studied for its potential role in supporting immune function and reducing inflammation in the respiratory tract.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus lozenge has health benefits such as soothing sore throats and reducing inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of colds, flu, and other respiratory infections. The lozenge form allows for easy consumption and prolonged contact with the throat, enhancing its effectiveness.

<p>Additionally, it is known for its calming effects, which can help ease stress and promote relaxation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus lozenge active constituents include humulone, lupulone, and other bitter acids, along with flavonoids and polyphenols.</p>
<p>These compounds are known for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The lozenge is often used to support respiratory health by helping to soothe sore throats and reduce coughing. It may also aid in digestion due to its bitter compounds that stimulate digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is sometimes used for its potential calming effects on the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Humulus lupulus lozenge, start by harvesting or purchasing dried hops (Humulus lupulus).</p>
<p>Next, grind the dried hops into a fine powder to increase surface area for better extraction. In a saucepan, combine the hop powder with a small amount of water and heat it gently to create a concentrated infusion. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any solids.</p>
<p>Finally, mix the strained liquid with a binding agent like honey or gum arabic and pour the mixture into molds, allowing it to set before use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus lozenge may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, due to its bitter compounds.</p>
<p>It can also cause drowsiness or dizziness in some individuals, particularly when taken in higher doses. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as the active compounds in hops are metabolized by the liver. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, such as sedatives or blood thinners, increasing the risk of adverse effects.</p>
<p>Individuals with a history of liver disease or allergies to plants in the Cannabaceae family should avoid this preparation.</p>
