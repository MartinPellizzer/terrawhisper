<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to extract their active compounds. In a saucepan, combine the chopped leaves with a small amount of water and simmer gently for about 15 minutes to create a concentrated herbal infusion. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove plant material, then mix the liquid with a binder such as honey or gum arabic to form a thick, sticky consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the mixture into molds and allow it to set at room temperature or in the refrigerator until firm, creating a ready-to-use lozenge for throat relief and respiratory support.</p>
