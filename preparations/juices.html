<h2 id="0">What is a juice?</h2>
<p>Juices are liquid extracts made by pressing or squeezing fresh fruits, vegetables, or herbs to extract their natural fluids.</p>
<p>Unlike teas, tinctures, or decoctions, juices are not cooked or steeped, preserving the raw nutrients and enzymes in their original form. They are typically consumed fresh and quickly, making them a more immediate source of hydration and nutrients compared to other herbal preparations. Juices are particularly beneficial for their high vitamin and mineral content, and they can be easily customized to support specific health goals.</p>
<p>Compared to other herbal preparations, juices offer a more direct and natural way to consume plant-based nutrients.</p>

<h2 id="1">How juice works?</h2>
<p>Juices work by extracting bioactive compounds from plant materials through processes like maceration, infusion, or cold pressing, which rely on solubility and the physical properties of the juice's components.</p>
<p>These methods often involve minimal heat to preserve heat-sensitive nutrients, and sometimes alcohol or water is used as a solvent to enhance extraction efficiency. The active constituents typically found in juices include vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and enzymes, which are naturally present in the plant cells. These compounds are absorbed through the digestive tract and delivered to the bloodstream, where they exert their therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>The potency of the juice depends on the concentration of these active ingredients and their bioavailability, which can be influenced by the preparation method and the individual's health status.</p>

<h2 id="2">What are the best herbal juices?</h2>
<p>Some of the best herbal juices for medicinal purposes are Zingiber officinale, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Curcuma longa, Ginkgo biloba, and Echinacea purpurea.</p>
<p>Zingiber officinale, or ginger, is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. Glycyrrhiza glabra, or licorice root, supports respiratory health and has soothing properties.</p>
<p>Curcuma longa, or turmeric, is prized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Ginkgo biloba enhances cognitive function and improves blood circulation.</p>
<p>Echinacea purpurea boosts the immune system and is effective in reducing the duration of colds.</p>
