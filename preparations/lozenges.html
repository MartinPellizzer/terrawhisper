<p>Lozenges are small, medicated tablets designed to dissolve slowly in the mouth.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in herbalism to deliver concentrated herbal extracts directly to the throat and respiratory tract. These preparations often contain herbs like echinacea, licorice root, or sage, which are known for their soothing and antimicrobial properties. Lozenges are particularly effective for treating sore throats, coughs, and other respiratory discomforts.</p>
<p>In herbal practice, they serve as a convenient and targeted method of administering medicinal herbs for localized relief.</p>

<h2 id="0">What is a lozenge?</h2>
<p>Lozenges are small, dissolvable tablets or candies used to soothe sore throats and promote oral health.</p>
<p>Unlike capsules or tinctures, lozenges are designed to dissolve slowly in the mouth, allowing the active ingredients to be released gradually. They are often made with herbal extracts such as echinacea, sage, or licorice root, which can have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Compared to other herbal preparations, lozenges offer a more targeted and localized effect, making them ideal for throat-related ailments.</p>
<p>Their convenience and ease of use make them a popular choice for both adults and children seeking natural remedies for minor respiratory discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="1">How lozenge works?</h2>
<p>Lozenges work by dissolving slowly in the mouth, allowing active ingredients to be released gradually and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the oral cavity.</p>
<p>This method of delivery relies on solubility principles, where the active compounds dissolve in saliva, and extraction techniques such as infusion or maceration are used to transfer the constituents from the herbal material. Common active constituents include essential oils, flavonoids, and glycosides, which are often extracted using heat or alcohol to enhance their bioavailability. These compounds are then absorbed through the oral mucosa, providing localized relief for conditions like sore throat or cough.</p>
<p>The slow release and direct absorption enhance the potency and effectiveness of the herbal preparation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What are the best herbal lozenges?</h2>
<p>Some of the best herbal lozenges for medicinal purposes are those containing Zingiber officinale, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Echinacea purpurea, Ginkgo biloba, and Curcuma longa.</p>
<p>Zingiber officinale, or ginger, is known for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits, making it ideal for soothing sore throats. Glycyrrhiza glabra, or licorice root, has expectorant properties that help clear mucus and reduce coughing.</p>
<p>Echinacea purpurea boosts the immune system and is effective in reducing the duration of colds. Ginkgo biloba improves circulation and may support cognitive function, while Curcuma longa, or turmeric, contains curcumin, a powerful antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Together, these herbs offer a comprehensive approach to supporting respiratory and immune health.</p>
