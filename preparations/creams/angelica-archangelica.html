<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Angelica archangelica cream, start by gathering fresh or dried Angelica archangelica roots, which are known for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. In a double boiler, combine the chopped roots with a small amount of water and simmer gently for about 30 minutes to create a concentrated herbal infusion. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve to remove solid particles, then mix in a carrier oil such as almond or coconut oil to create a smooth cream.</p>
<p>Store the finished cream in a cool, dark place and use it topically for its purported skin-soothing and digestive benefits.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>

<p>It can also cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in individuals with sensitive skin. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as some compounds in angelica are known to be hepatotoxic. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
