In modern times, it is widely used in skincare products for its ability to reduce redness and promote healing.</p>
<p>Its popularity continues due to its natural composition and effectiveness in addressing various dermatological concerns.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Calendula officinalis cream, start by infusing dried calendula flowers in a carrier oil such as olive oil or coconut oil.</p>
<p>Heat the oil gently over low heat for about 30 minutes, then strain the infused oil through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Once the oil is cool, mix it with beeswax and a small amount of water or distilled alcohol to create a stable cream base. Blend the mixture thoroughly until it reaches a smooth, creamy consistency.</p>
<p>Store the finished cream in a sterilized jar in a cool, dark place, where it will remain effective for several weeks.</p>

<p>Calendula officinalis cream may lead to mild skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin or a known allergy to plants in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is generally considered safe for topical use, but prolonged application may cause contact dermatitis, characterized by redness, itching, or a burning sensation. While rare, some people may experience more severe reactions such as hives or swelling. It is advisable to perform a patch test before using the cream extensively.</p>
