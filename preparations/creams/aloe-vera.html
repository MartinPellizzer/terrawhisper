<p>Overall, aloe vera cream is a natural remedy that supports skin health and provides relief for various dermatological conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

Next, mix the Aloe vera gel with a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba oil, in a ratio of 1:1 to create a creamy consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, store the mixture in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Aloe vera cream may lead to skin irritation, redness, or allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<p>It is generally considered safe for topical use, but prolonged application can cause gastrointestinal discomfort if ingested. Some people may experience a burning sensation or dryness at the application site. In rare cases, it may interact with certain medications or exacerbate existing skin conditions.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using aloe vera cream to check for adverse reactions.</p>
