<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum cream reduces blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving circulation, which helps lower systemic vascular resistance.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, such as cinnamaldehyde and polyphenols. The cream improves heart health by reducing oxidative stress and supporting healthy cholesterol levels. It may help treat diabetes symptoms by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can relieve menstrual cramps due to its ability to reduce uterine inflammation and muscle spasms.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum cream contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a key compound responsible for its aromatic scent and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Eugenol, another constituent, contributes to the cream's anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, making it useful for skin irritation. Gallic acid provides antioxidant benefits and helps in protecting the skin from oxidative stress. Cinnamyl alcohol acts as a natural preservative and also has mild antimicrobial activity.</p>
<p>Lastly, lignans in the cream offer additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support, enhancing its overall therapeutic value.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum cream primarily utilizes the bark of the plant, which contains the essential oils and compounds responsible for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The inner bark, known as the cinnamon bark, is the most commonly used part due to its high concentration of cinnamaldehyde and other aromatic compounds. While leaves and roots are occasionally used, they are less prevalent in the formulation of medicinal creams compared to the bark. The bark is typically harvested, dried, and ground into a powder before being incorporated into the cream base.</p>
<p>This part of the plant is valued for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and warming effects, making it a key ingredient in many therapeutic creams.</p>
