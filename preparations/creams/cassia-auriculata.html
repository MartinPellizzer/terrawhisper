<p>Cassia auriculata cream is a topical herbal preparation made from the flowers of the Cassia auriculata plant, commonly known as the golden shower tree.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbalism to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and fungal infections due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The cream is often applied directly to the affected area to soothe irritation and promote healing. It is also believed to have a calming effect on the skin and may help reduce redness and itching.</p>
<p>This preparation is valued in traditional medicine for its natural and holistic approach to skin care.</p>

<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata cream is primarily made using the leaves, which are rich in compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are often harvested when they are fully mature to ensure maximum potency. The roots are also commonly used, as they contain bioactive compounds that contribute to the cream's healing effects. In some traditional formulations, the flowers may be included to enhance the creamâ€™s soothing properties.</p>
<p>These parts are carefully processed to extract their therapeutic benefits for skin conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dryness or flaking of the skin due to its natural astringent properties. Some users might experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or swelling, if they are allergic to any of the plant's components. Prolonged use could result in skin sensitivity or a decrease in skin moisture, requiring careful monitoring.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before applying the cream to a larger area of skin.</p>
