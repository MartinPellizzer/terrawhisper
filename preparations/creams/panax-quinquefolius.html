<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Panax quinquefolius cream reduces stress levels by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system through its adaptogenic properties.</p>
<p>It improves sleep quality by regulating the body's circadian rhythms and enhancing the restorative effects of sleep. The cream also reduces anxiety symptoms by modulating neurotransmitter activity and reducing cortisol levels. Additionally, it boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of immune cells and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Finally, it increases energy levels by supporting metabolic functions and improving overall vitality.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Panax quinquefolius cream contains saponins, which are known for their ability to enhance the absorption of other nutrients and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Polyacetylenes present in the cream contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting skin health. Glycosides in the formulation help in reducing oxidative stress and promoting cellular repair. Triterpenes provide additional anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory benefits, enhancing the cream's therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>Phenolic acids further contribute to the cream's antioxidant capacity, protecting the skin from free radical damage.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Panax quinquefolius cream is primarily made using the roots of the American ginseng plant, which are the most valued part for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The roots are harvested after several years of growth to ensure maximum potency and active compound concentration. These roots are then processed into extracts or powders, which are incorporated into the cream formulation. The leaves of the plant are sometimes used as well, but they contribute less to the medicinal effects compared to the roots.</p>
<p>Overall, the roots are the most critical component in creating the therapeutic benefits of Panax quinquefolius cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Panax quinquefolius cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience allergic reactions, such as hives or swelling, due to an intolerance to the active ingredients. It is also possible for the cream to cause dryness or a tingling sensation as the body adjusts to the herbal components. In rare cases, more severe reactions like contact dermatitis may occur, requiring medical attention.</p>
<p>Always perform a patch test before applying the cream to a larger area of skin.</p>
