<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Aesculus hippocastanum cream treats varicose veins by improving blood circulation and reducing venous pressure.</p>
<p>It also reduces inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties, which can alleviate symptoms in conditions like arthritis or skin irritations. The cream boosts the immune system by enhancing the body's natural defenses against pathogens. Additionally, it fights infections by promoting healing and preventing bacterial growth on the skin.</p>
<p>Finally, it can reduce cough by soothing the respiratory tract and decreasing irritation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Aesculus hippocastanum cream contains aesculetin, a flavonoid with antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation and support skin health.</p>
<p>It also includes saponins, which are natural detergents that can enhance the penetration of other active ingredients and have mild antimicrobial effects. Flavonoids present in the cream contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, promoting overall skin wellness. Phenolic acids in the formulation provide additional antioxidant benefits, protecting the skin from oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Alkaloids, though present in smaller amounts, may offer neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting the cream's therapeutic potential.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Aesculus hippocastanum cream is commonly made using the bark, leaves, and seeds of the horse chestnut tree.</p>
<p>The bark is often harvested during the winter months and dried for use in formulations. Leaves are collected in the summer and processed to extract their medicinal compounds. Seeds, although toxic in their raw form, are sometimes used after careful preparation.</p>
<p>These parts are valued for their anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits in topical applications.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Aesculus hippocastanum cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash, especially if the user is allergic to any of its ingredients. In some cases, the cream can cause a tingling or numbness sensation, which might be mistaken for a therapeutic effect. Prolonged use may result in skin dryness or peeling due to its astringent properties.</p>
<p>It is important to discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional if severe adverse reactions occur.</p>
