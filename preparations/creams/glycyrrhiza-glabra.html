<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra cream is a topical preparation made from the root of the licorice plant, known for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in herbalism to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and minor irritations due to its ability to reduce inflammation and promote healing. The cream may also help alleviate symptoms of respiratory conditions when applied externally, though it is not a substitute for internal treatments. It is often combined with other herbs to enhance its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>However, prolonged use should be avoided as it may cause side effects like hypertension.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra cream eases digestive issues by reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and soothing irritation.</p>
<p>It treats ulcers effectively due to its ability to protect the stomach lining and promote healing. The cream eases coughs quickly by acting as an expectorant and reducing throat inflammation. It treats skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis by calming irritation and promoting skin regeneration.</p>
<p>Additionally, it eases joint pains through its anti-inflammatory properties, offering relief for conditions like arthritis.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra cream contains glycyrrhizin, a potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral compound that modulates immune responses.</p>
<p>Saponins present in the cream contribute to its antimicrobial properties and help in the penetration of other active ingredients through the skin. Triterpenoids, another key component, provide additional anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing benefits. Lipids in the cream act as emollients, enhancing skin hydration and barrier function.</p>
<p>Saponin glycosides further support the cream's efficacy by enhancing its therapeutic effects and promoting skin health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra cream is primarily made using the roots of the plant, which contain high concentrations of active compounds like glycyrrhizin.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part due to their potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. They are typically harvested during the autumn season when the concentration of beneficial compounds is at its peak. The roots are often dried and ground into a powder before being incorporated into the cream formulation.</p>
<p>This makes the roots the most essential component in the production of Glycyrrhiza glabra cream.</p>
