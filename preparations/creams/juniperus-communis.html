<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis cream treats urinary issues by promoting healthy urinary tract function and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>It soothes skin irritations with its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective for conditions like eczema and rashes. The cream also treats respiratory issues by helping to clear congestion and reduce mucus buildup in the airways. It is known to treat kidney stones by supporting the elimination of toxins and promoting urinary flow.</p>
<p>Additionally, it detoxifies liver tissue by enhancing metabolic processes and aiding in the removal of harmful substances from the body.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis cream contains α-pinene, a monoterpene known for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which contribute to the cream's therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Limonene, another terpene present in the cream, offers antioxidant and skin-soothing benefits, enhancing its overall efficacy. Sesquiterpenes in the formulation provide additional anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, supporting skin health. Phytosterols help in reducing inflammation and promoting skin barrier function, making the cream suitable for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>β-pinene, similar to α-pinene, contributes to the cream's aromatic profile while also exhibiting antimicrobial and analgesic properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Juniperus communis cream is primarily made using the leaves and berries of the plant, which are rich in essential oils and antioxidants.</p>
<p>The leaves are often harvested during the summer months and dried to extract their aromatic compounds. The berries, known for their distinctive sharp flavor, are also commonly used due to their high concentration of beneficial compounds. In some formulations, the roots may be included for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, the most frequently utilized parts are the leaves and berries, which contribute the main therapeutic effects of the cream.</p>
