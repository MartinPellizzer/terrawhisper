<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream has been used to treat various ailments throughout history, particularly in traditional European medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, often applied to soothe skin irritations and reduce swelling. In traditional practices, it was also used to support respiratory health and alleviate symptoms of colds and flu. Modern research has explored its use in topical applications for conditions like eczema and psoriasis, though scientific evidence remains limited.</p>
<p>Today, it is sometimes used as a natural remedy, but it should be approached with caution due to potential toxicity if not prepared properly.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream has health benefits such as reducing inflammation, supporting the immune system, and promoting skin health.</p>
<p>It contains antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals in the body, which can contribute to aging and disease. The cream may also have antiviral and antimicrobial properties, making it useful for treating minor skin infections or irritations. Its anti-inflammatory effects can help alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis or eczema.</p>
<p>Overall, Sambucus nigra cream is a natural remedy that offers a range of therapeutic benefits for both internal and external use.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream active constituents include flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides, which contribute to its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. The flavonoids help neutralize free radicals, supporting cellular health and reducing oxidative stress. Saponins may enhance immune function and have antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides are believed to boost the immune system and may aid in the body's natural defense mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Sambucus nigra cream, start by harvesting the ripe berries of the European elderberry plant, ensuring they are fully mature and free from mold.</p>
<p>Rinse the berries thoroughly and simmer them in a pot with water for about 30 minutes to extract their juice. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve to remove any pulp or seeds, then combine the liquid with a base of honey or a carrier oil such as almond oil. Allow the mixture to cool and blend it into a smooth cream consistency using a hand blender or immersion blender.</p>
<p>Store the cream in a cool, dark place or refrigerate for extended shelf life.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream may lead to gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high concentration of compounds like sambucol.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or more severe symptoms like anaphylaxis. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as some studies suggest potential hepatotoxic effects from the compounds in the preparation. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or blood clotting.</p>
<p>Users should consult a healthcare professional before using Sambucus nigra cream, especially if they have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
