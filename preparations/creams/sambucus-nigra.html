<p>Sambucus nigra cream is a topical herbal preparation made from the berries of the European elder tree, often combined with other herbs and a base such as beeswax or shea butter.</p>
<p>It is used in herbalism to soothe skin irritations, reduce inflammation, and promote healing due to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The cream may be applied to wounds, rashes, or insect bites to aid in the recovery process. It is also sometimes used to alleviate symptoms of colds and flu when applied externally.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution, as some parts of the elder plant can be toxic if not properly prepared.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream fights viral infections by boosting the immune system and inhibiting viral replication.</p>
<p>It relieves coughs through its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that calm irritated airways. The cream also relieves sore throats by reducing inflammation and providing a protective barrier over the mucous membranes. Additionally, it treats cold sores by targeting the herpes simplex virus with its antiviral compounds.</p>
<p>Finally, it fights bacterial infections due to its antimicrobial properties that help prevent the spread of harmful pathogens.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream contains isosalipurpurin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p>
<p>It is also rich in flavonoids, which contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The cream includes phenolic acids that help neutralize free radicals and support skin health. Lignans present in the cream offer additional antioxidant and immune-modulating benefits.</p>
<p>Terpenoids further enhance the cream's efficacy by providing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory support.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream is commonly made using the berries, leaves, and flowers of the plant.</p>
<p>The berries are the most frequently used part due to their high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. Leaves are also utilized for their soothing properties and are often dried and ground into powder for topical application. Flowers are sometimes included to enhance the cream's calming and skin-repairing effects.</p>
<p>Roots are less commonly used in modern formulations but have been historically valued for their medicinal properties.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash in some users. Prolonged use might result in skin dryness or increased sensitivity to sunlight. In rare cases, it can cause more severe reactions like swelling or blistering.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using the cream regularly.</p>
