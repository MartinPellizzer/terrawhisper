<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera cream eradicates free radicals by providing potent antioxidant properties that neutralize harmful molecules in the body.</p>
<p>It improves heart health by reducing oxidative stress and supporting healthy blood pressure levels. The cream protects liver function by promoting detoxification and reducing damage caused by toxins. It reduces inflammation through its anti-inflammatory compounds, which can alleviate symptoms of various chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it increases antioxidant levels in the body, enhancing overall cellular health and immunity.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera cream contains epicatechin, a powerful antioxidant that supports cardiovascular health and skin rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Resveratrol, another key constituent, is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties, promoting cellular longevity. Anthocyanins contribute to the cream's vibrant color and offer protective benefits against oxidative stress. Quercetin, a flavonoid, enhances the cream's efficacy by providing additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support.</p>
<p>Sugars in the formulation help to enhance the sensory experience and contribute to the cream's moisturizing properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera cream typically incorporates various parts of the plant, with the leaves being one of the most commonly used components due to their high concentration of bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>The roots of the Vitis vinifera plant are also frequently utilized for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Additionally, the bark and stems contribute to the formulation, offering further therapeutic benefits. The berries, although primarily used in winemaking, are sometimes included in creams for their skin-nourishing properties.</p>
<p>These parts are carefully selected and processed to maximize the medicinal efficacy of the final product.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rashes in those who are allergic to grapes or related compounds. Some users may experience dryness or a tight feeling on the skin due to its astringent properties. In rare cases, it can trigger contact dermatitis, which is an inflammatory skin reaction.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using the cream to minimize the risk of adverse effects.</p>
