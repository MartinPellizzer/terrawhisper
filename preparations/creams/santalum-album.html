<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Santalum album cream calms anxiety by promoting a sense of tranquility through its calming aroma and natural ingredients.</p>
<p>It soothes the skin by providing a gentle, non-irritating relief that helps reduce redness and irritation. This cream also reduces stress by supporting emotional balance and relaxation, making it ideal for use during moments of tension. Additionally, it heals burns by creating a protective barrier that accelerates the recovery process.</p>
<p>Finally, it relieves pain through its anti-inflammatory properties, offering comfort for various skin conditions and minor aches.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Santalum album cream contains β-santalol, which is known for its calming and aromatic properties, contributing to the cream's soothing effects.</p>
<p>Phenylethanoid glycosides provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, helping to protect the skin from oxidative stress. α-santalol, another key constituent, works synergistically with β-santalol to enhance the cream's therapeutic properties. Santalbic acid offers antimicrobial and skin-soothing effects, supporting overall skin health.</p>
<p>Triterpenoids contribute to the cream's ability to promote skin regeneration and maintain a balanced complexion.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Santalum album cream is primarily made using the heartwood of the tree, which contains the highest concentration of santolium, the key compound responsible for its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The bark is also commonly used, as it contains essential oils and other bioactive compounds that contribute to the cream's effectiveness. The leaves of Santalum album are sometimes incorporated for their mild antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits. The roots, although less frequently used, may be included in some formulations for their purported grounding and healing properties.</p>
<p>However, the most prized and widely utilized part of the plant remains the heartwood due to its rich composition and potency.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Santalum album cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness and itching, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dryness or a tight sensation on the skin, especially with prolonged use. Some users might experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or swelling, if they are sensitive to the ingredients. In rare cases, it may cause a burning sensation or tingling upon application.</p>
<p>It is recommended to perform a patch test before using the cream regularly to identify any adverse reactions.</p>
