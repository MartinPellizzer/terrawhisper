<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus cream relaxes nervous system by promoting a calming effect on the body, which can help alleviate tension and promote overall well-being.</p>
<p>It relieves anxiety symptoms through its soothing properties, making it a natural alternative for those seeking relief from mental stress. The cream also reduces stress hormones like cortisol, supporting a more balanced physiological response to stress. Additionally, it reduces inflammation in the body, which can contribute to various health conditions and discomfort.</p>
<p>Finally, by calming the mind and body, it improves sleep quality, helping users achieve more restful and rejuvenating rest.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus cream contains xanthohumol, a prenylated flavonoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Humulone and lupulone, which are bitter acids, contribute to the cream's antimicrobial and antifungal effects. Hesperidin, a flavonoid glycoside, supports skin health by enhancing capillary strength and reducing inflammation. Kaempferol, another flavonoid, exhibits strong antioxidant and anti-cancer activities.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make the cream beneficial for treating various skin conditions and promoting overall skin wellness.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus cream is commonly made using the dried cones of the plant, which are the most potent part for medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The cones contain lupulins, which are responsible for the plant's anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used in formulations, they are less concentrated compared to the cones. The roots of Humulus lupulus are rarely used in creams due to their minimal medicinal contribution.</p>
<p>Overall, the cones remain the primary and most effective part of the plant used in the preparation of medicinal creams.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash in some users. Prolonged use might result in dryness or peeling of the skin due to its drying properties. In rare cases, it can cause contact dermatitis, which is an inflammatory reaction to the plant compounds.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before applying the cream to a larger area of the skin.</p>
