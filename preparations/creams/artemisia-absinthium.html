<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, often applied to wounds and skin irritations. In ancient times, it was also used to alleviate symptoms of malaria and other fevers, though its efficacy in these contexts remains debated. Modern applications include its use in topical treatments for eczema, psoriasis, and fungal infections due to its potential antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>Today, it is increasingly sought after in natural and alternative medicine for its purported soothing and healing properties.</p>

<p>However, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
