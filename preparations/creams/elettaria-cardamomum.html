<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum cream ease digestion issues by stimulating the digestive system and reducing bloating and gas.</p>
<p>Its natural compounds help boost the immune system by fighting off harmful pathogens and supporting overall body defenses. Regular use of this cream may lower cholesterol levels due to its antioxidant properties that help reduce bad cholesterol. It also has calming effects that can reduce anxiety levels by promoting relaxation and reducing stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cream may contribute to lowering blood pressure by improving circulation and reducing inflammation in the body.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum cream contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The cream also includes volatile oils, contributing to its aromatic profile and potential therapeutic effects. Saponins present in the cream may support skin health by promoting detoxification and enhancing skin barrier function. Limonene, a terpene found in the cream, is recognized for its ability to enhance skin absorption of other active ingredients.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cream contains fatty acids that help moisturize and nourish the skin, improving its overall texture and hydration.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum cream is primarily made using the essential oils extracted from the seeds of the cardamom plant.</p>
<p>The seeds, which are the most valuable part of the plant, are harvested and dried to concentrate their aromatic and medicinal properties. These oils are then blended with base ingredients like coconut oil or shea butter to create the cream. The leaves of the plant are sometimes used as a secondary component for their mild antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Roots are rarely used in medicinal creams due to their limited contribution compared to the seeds and oils.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Elettaria cardamomum cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash in those who are allergic to cardamom or other ingredients in the cream. Some users may experience a tingling or numbing sensation due to the essential oils present in the formulation. Prolonged use could potentially result in dryness or peeling of the skin.</p>
<p>It is advisable to perform a patch test before applying the cream extensively to minimize these side effects.</p>
