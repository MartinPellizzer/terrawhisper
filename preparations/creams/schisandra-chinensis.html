<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis cream boost brain power by enhancing cognitive function and improving mental clarity through its adaptogenic properties.</p>
<p>It promotes healthy aging by supporting cellular repair and reducing oxidative stress, which helps maintain youthful skin and overall vitality. The cream protects skin cells from environmental damage and premature aging, thanks to its rich antioxidant content. It strengthens the immune system by stimulating the bodyâ€™s natural defenses and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it calms the nervous system, helping to reduce stress and improve emotional balance.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis cream contains schisandrin a, a lignan compound known for its antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties.</p>
<p>Alongside schisandrin a, the cream also includes gomisin a, another lignan that exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Cellulose is present as a bulking agent, providing structural support and aiding in the formulation's texture. Terpenoids contribute to the cream's overall bioactivity, offering antimicrobial and skin-soothing benefits.</p>
<p>Finally, schisandrin b, another key lignan, supports the cream's efficacy in promoting skin health and cellular repair.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis cream is primarily made using the fruit of the plant, which is the most commonly utilized part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The fruit contains valuable compounds like lignans, which are responsible for the plant's adaptogenic and antioxidant effects. While the leaves and roots are sometimes used in traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the fruit. The seeds and pulp are also occasionally incorporated to enhance the cream's therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the fruit remains the key component in most formulations of Schisandra chinensis cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Schisandra chinensis cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or rash, due to an adverse response to the herbal ingredients. It may also lead to dryness or flakiness, as the formula can be drying to the skin in certain cases. In rare instances, it might cause a tingling or numbness sensation, though this is typically temporary.</p>
<p>Overall, while generally safe for most people, it is important to perform a patch test before full application to minimize the risk of these side effects.</p>
