<p>Cannabis sativa cream is a topical herbal preparation made from cannabis plant extracts, typically containing cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>It is used in herbalism to provide localized relief for conditions such as pain, inflammation, and skin irritation. The cream is applied directly to the skin to target specific areas of discomfort without causing systemic effects. It is often favored for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>This preparation is used in both traditional and modern herbal practices for its therapeutic benefits.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cannabis sativa cream reduces nausea symptoms by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system, which helps regulate gastrointestinal function.</p>
<p>It also relieves chronic pain through its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a valuable option for those suffering from long-term discomfort. The cream has shown potential in treating epilepsy seizures by modulating neuronal activity and reducing seizure frequency. Additionally, it can reduce stress levels and ease anxiety attacks by promoting relaxation and balancing mood-related neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Overall, Cannabis sativa cream offers a multifaceted approach to managing various health conditions through its therapeutic compounds.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cannabis sativa cream contains cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component, also contributes to the cream's therapeutic effects by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system. Limonene, a terpene found in the cannabis plant, offers antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits while also promoting a sense of well-being. Pinene, another terpene, enhances the absorption of other compounds and has potential anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cream includes various fatty acids that moisturize the skin and support overall skin health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cannabis sativa cream typically utilizes the leaves and flowers of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentration of cannabinoids like CBD and THC.</p>
<p>The leaves are often ground and infused into the cream to provide therapeutic effects. The flowers, known as buds, are also commonly used due to their rich cannabinoid profile. Roots and stems are less frequently used in medicinal creams because they contain lower levels of active compounds.</p>
<p>However, in some traditional formulations, the roots may be included for additional herbal properties.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cannabis sativa cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or swelling, particularly if the user is allergic to cannabis or other ingredients in the formulation. In some cases, prolonged use can result in skin dryness or a greasy texture, which may affect the skin's natural barrier. Additionally, there is a risk of systemic absorption, which could lead to mild psychoactive effects in some users.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using cannabis sativa cream, especially for those with pre-existing skin conditions or medical concerns.</p>
