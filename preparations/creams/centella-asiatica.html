<p>Centella asiatica cream is a topical preparation made from the extract of the Centella asiatica plant, also known as gotu kola.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbalism to promote skin healing, reduce inflammation, and enhance wound recovery. The cream is applied directly to the skin to treat conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and minor burns. It is also believed to improve circulation and support the health of connective tissues.</p>
<p>Its calming and regenerative properties make it a popular choice in natural medicine for its soothing and healing effects.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica cream improves skin texture by promoting collagen production and enhancing skin elasticity, resulting in a smoother and more youthful appearance.</p>
<p>It protects against oxidation by containing antioxidants that neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and preventing premature aging. This cream supports wound healing through its ability to stimulate cell proliferation and tissue repair, making it beneficial for skin recovery. Additionally, it boosts brain function by increasing the production of nerve growth factors, which aid in neural repair and regeneration.</p>
<p>Finally, it enhances cognitive power by improving blood circulation to the brain and supporting the synthesis of neurotransmitters essential for mental clarity and focus.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica cream contains triterpenoid glycosides, which are known for their ability to promote skin repair and enhance collagen synthesis.</p>
<p>These compounds work synergistically with triterpenoid saponins, which also contribute to the cream's wound-healing properties by stimulating cell proliferation. Asiatic acid and madecassoside are key active ingredients that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, helping to reduce redness and irritation. Additionally, triterpene esters in the cream support the regeneration of skin tissue and improve skin elasticity.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Centella asiatica cream a potent formulation for improving skin health and appearance.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica cream is primarily made using the leaves of the plant, which are rich in active compounds like asiatic acid and madecassic acid.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested when they are young and tender to ensure maximum potency. The roots are also used in some formulations, though less commonly than the leaves, and they contain similar beneficial compounds. Both the leaves and roots are typically processed into extracts or oils to incorporate into the cream.</p>
<p>These parts are valued for their wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and skin-repairing properties.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or rash, if they are allergic to any of the ingredients. It may also lead to dryness or flakiness, particularly if used excessively or on very dry skin. In rare cases, it can result in a tingling or numbing sensation, which is usually temporary.</p>
<p>However, these side effects are generally mild and uncommon when the cream is used as directed.</p>
