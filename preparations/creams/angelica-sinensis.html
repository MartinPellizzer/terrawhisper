<p>This preparation is valued for its soothing and nourishing effects on the skin and internal organs.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis cream reduces inflammation by containing active compounds that inhibit inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of immune cells and antibodies. This cream can relieve headaches by improving blood circulation and reducing muscle tension. It eases pain through its analgesic properties, making it effective for various types of discomfort.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces stress by promoting relaxation and balancing the body's natural stress response.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis cream contains ligustilide, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it beneficial for skin health.</p>
<p>Butylphthalide contributes to the cream's ability to improve circulation and reduce swelling. Quercetin, a potent antioxidant, helps protect the skin from oxidative stress and promotes healing. Ursolic acid supports skin regeneration and has antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>Beta-sitosterol aids in reducing inflammation and enhancing the skin's barrier function, making the cream effective for various dermatological conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis cream is primarily made using the roots of the plant, which are the most valued and medicinally active part.</p>
<p>The roots contain high concentrations of compounds like ligustilide and ferulic acid, which contribute to its therapeutic properties. While other parts such as the leaves and stems may be used in some formulations, they are less common and not as potent as the roots. The root is typically dried and processed into a fine powder before being incorporated into the cream.</p>
<p>This makes the roots the most essential component in the preparation of Angelica sinensis cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience allergic reactions such as hives or swelling, especially if they are allergic to other components in the cream. It can also lead to contact dermatitis, which is a type of eczema triggered by direct skin contact with the product. In rare cases, it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort if ingested, though this is not a typical side effect of topical use.</p>
<p>Overall, it is important to perform a patch test before using the cream to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.</p>
