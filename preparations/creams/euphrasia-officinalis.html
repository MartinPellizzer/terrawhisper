<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis cream reduces inflammation in the eye area, making it effective for conditions like conjunctivitis and irritated eyelids.</p>
<p>It helps heal eye infections by soothing the delicate tissues and promoting faster recovery. The cream also fights bacterial infections due to its natural antimicrobial properties. It is known to cure blepharitis by reducing redness, swelling, and the buildup of bacteria along the eyelids.</p>
<p>Additionally, it treats keratitis by supporting the healing of corneal inflammation and infection.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis cream contains iridoid glycosides, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help reduce eye strain and irritation, making the cream beneficial for ocular health. Additionally, the cream includes phenolic glycosides, which contribute to its soothing and protective effects on the skin and mucous membranes. Flavonoids present in the cream further enhance its antioxidant activity and support overall tissue repair.</p>
<p>Alkaloids and carbohydrates also play roles in modulating immune responses and providing structural support to the formulation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis cream is primarily made using the plant's leaves and roots, which are the most commonly utilized parts for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested during the early flowering stage to maximize their active compounds, such as flavonoids and iridoids. The roots, known for their high concentration of mucilage and tannins, are often dried and ground into a fine powder for inclusion in the cream. These components work together to provide anti-inflammatory and soothing effects, making the cream effective for skin conditions like eczema and conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>The combination of leaves and roots ensures a balanced therapeutic profile in the final product.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis cream can cause mild skin irritation, such as redness or itching, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to a burning sensation or dryness at the application site. Allergic reactions, though rare, can occur and may include hives or swelling. Overuse of the cream might result in skin sensitivity or increased dryness.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional if severe side effects persist.</p>
