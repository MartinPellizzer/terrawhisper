<p>This preparation is valued for its gentle yet effective nature in supporting skin health and healing.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis cream treat mouth ulcers by soothing the inflamed tissues and promoting faster healing due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>It can also treat gum disease by reducing bacterial growth and inflammation, supporting overall oral health. The cream helps relieve skin itch by moisturizing and calming irritated skin, making it suitable for various dermatological conditions. Additionally, it can treat vaginal itch by providing a soothing effect and reducing irritation caused by infections or hormonal changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, it may help reduce menstrual pain by easing cramps and discomfort through its calming and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis cream contains mucilages, which are viscous polysaccharide compounds that form a protective barrier on the skin.</p>
<p>These mucilages also include polysaccharides that have soothing and hydrating properties, helping to reduce inflammation and promote skin repair. Starch present in the cream acts as a natural thickener and contributes to its smooth texture. Galactose and glucose, both simple sugars, provide additional moisturizing effects and support skin cell regeneration.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Althaea officinalis cream effective for treating dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis cream is primarily made using the roots and leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly utilized parts for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The roots are harvested during the autumn and are known for their high mucilage content, which provides soothing and emollient effects. The leaves, often collected in the summer, are also rich in mucilage and are used to create the base of the cream. These parts are typically dried and ground into a fine powder before being mixed with other ingredients.</p>
<p>The combination of root and leaf extracts gives the cream its characteristic thick, creamy texture and therapeutic benefits.</p>
