<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinchona officinalis cream reduces fever by leveraging its active compounds that lower body temperature.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used to treat malaria due to its quinine content, which combats the malaria parasite. The cream may help lower blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving circulation. It can also cure quinine deficiency by replenishing essential nutrients and supporting metabolic functions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it improves the immune system by enhancing the body's natural defenses against infections and diseases.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinchona officinalis cream contains quinine, which is a key alkaloid known for its antimalarial and antidiarrheal properties.</p>
<p>Alongside quinine, the cream also includes quinidine, another alkaloid that acts as a cardiac glycoside and is used to treat arrhythmias. Cinchonine and cinchonidine are additional alkaloids present in the cream, contributing to its therapeutic effects and providing mild antipyretic and analgesic properties. Quinic acid, a natural organic acid, is also present and helps in stabilizing the formulation and enhancing the solubility of the alkaloids.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents work synergistically to provide a range of medicinal benefits in the cream.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cinchona officinalis cream is primarily made using the bark of the plant, which contains the active compound quinine.</p>
<p>The inner bark, or the cortex, is the most commonly used part due to its high concentration of alkaloids. This part is harvested during the plant's maturity, typically after several years of growth. The bark is then processed to extract the essential oils and compounds used in the cream formulation.</p>
<p>The leaves of Cinchona officinalis are sometimes used as an adjunct, but the bark remains the primary source for medicinal properties.</p>
