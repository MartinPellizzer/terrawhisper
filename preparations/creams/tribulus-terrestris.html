<p>Tribulus terrestris cream is a topical herbal preparation made from the dried fruits of the Tribulus terrestris plant, commonly known as puncture vine.</p>
<p>This cream is used in herbalism to support skin health and may help with conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and minor skin irritations due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is often applied directly to the affected area to soothe inflammation and promote healing. The active compounds in Tribulus terrestris, such as saponins, are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>This preparation is valued in traditional medicine for its natural approach to addressing skin-related ailments.</p>

<ul><li><a href="#0">Plant Parts</a></li><li><a href="#1">Side Effects</a></li></ul>
<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris cream is commonly made using the plant's leaves, which are rich in alkaloids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>The roots are also frequently used due to their high concentration of saponins and other bioactive compounds. The flowers are sometimes included to enhance the cream's anti-inflammatory properties. The seeds are another key component, valued for their potential to support hormonal balance.</p>
<p>Together, these parts contribute to the cream's reputation for promoting skin health and overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash, especially if the person is allergic to any of the ingredients. In some cases, the cream may cause dryness or flaking of the skin due to its natural botanical components. Prolonged use might result in increased sensitivity to sunlight, so it is advisable to use sunscreen.</p>
<p>As with any topical product, it is important to perform a patch test before full application to minimize adverse effects.</p>
