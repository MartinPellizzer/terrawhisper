<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Bacopa monnieri cream contains bacosides, which are the primary active compounds known for their neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties.</p>
<p>Bitter alkaloids contribute to the cream's ability to support mental clarity and reduce anxiety by interacting with neurotransmitter systems. Rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid provide antioxidant benefits, helping to neutralize free radicals and reduce inflammation. Saponins in the cream also exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, enhancing overall skin health.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents work synergistically to promote cognitive function and skin rejuvenation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>

However, the primary component is the leaves, as they contain the highest concentration of beneficial compounds.</p>
<p>The aerial parts of the plant, including the leaves and stems, are often used in traditional preparations for their cognitive and calming effects.</p>
