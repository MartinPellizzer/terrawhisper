<p>The leaves are commonly used due to their high concentration of essential oils and flavonoids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. The roots are also a key component, valued for their ability to provide analgesic and antiseptic effects. The fruits, often dried and ground into a powder, are incorporated to enhance the cream's potency and provide additional therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Together, these parts are combined to create a versatile medicinal cream used for skin conditions and pain relief.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Zanthoxylum bungeanum cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness and itching, in some users.</p>
