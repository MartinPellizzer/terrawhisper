<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Salvia miltiorrhiza cream relieves chest pain by improving blood circulation and reducing oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>It lowers blood pressure through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which help relax blood vessels and reduce arterial stiffness. The cream also reduces inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, supporting overall heart health. Additionally, it lowers cholesterol levels by promoting the breakdown of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Finally, it treats heart failure by enhancing cardiac function and reducing the workload on the heart, making it a valuable natural remedy for cardiovascular conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Salvia miltiorrhiza cream contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Saponins contribute to the cream's ability to enhance skin hydration and improve cellular membrane integrity. Triterpenoids in the cream help in reducing oxidative stress and promoting skin repair. Polyphenols provide additional antioxidant support, protecting the skin from free radical damage.</p>
<p>Sesquiterpenoids further enhance the cream's efficacy by exhibiting antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Salvia miltiorrhiza cream primarily utilizes the roots of the plant, which contain high concentrations of active compounds like tanshinone and salvianolic acid.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part due to their rich medicinal properties and ability to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. While other parts like leaves and stems may be used in some formulations, they are less prevalent compared to the roots. The roots are typically processed through extraction methods to create the active ingredients for the cream.</p>
<p>This makes the roots the most critical component in the production of effective Salvia miltiorrhiza cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Salvia miltiorrhiza cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions such as hives or rash in some users. Prolonged use might result in skin dryness or increased sensitivity to sunlight. In rare cases, it can cause more severe reactions like swelling or difficulty breathing, requiring immediate medical attention.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before applying the cream widely to minimize adverse effects.</p>
