<p>It also boosts the immune system by providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals and support immune cell function.

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Sesamum indicum cream contains fatty acids that contribute to skin hydration and barrier function due to their emollient properties.</p>
<p>It also includes dietary fiber, which may support gut health and overall wellness when consumed internally. The cream is rich in polyphenols, powerful antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. Additionally, it contains sesamin and sesamolin, unique lignans known for their anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering benefits.</p>
<p>These bioactive constituents work synergistically to enhance the cream's therapeutic effects on the skin and overall health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>

The roots are less commonly utilized but may be included in some traditional remedies for their healing benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the seeds and leaves are the most used parts in the preparation of Sesamum indicum-based medicinal creams.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sesamum indicum cream can cause mild skin irritation or redness in some individuals due to its essential oil content.</p>
<p>It may also lead to a tingling or burning sensation upon application, especially in sensitive skin. Some users might experience allergic reactions such as itching or hives, although this is less common. The cream is generally considered safe for most skin types when used as directed.</p>
