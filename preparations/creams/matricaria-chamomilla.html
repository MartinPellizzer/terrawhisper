<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Matricaria chamomilla cream relieves digestive issues by soothing the gastrointestinal tract and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>It treats insomnia problems through its calming properties that promote relaxation and ease mental tension. The cream improves sleep quality by supporting the body’s natural restorative processes and reducing nighttime awakenings. It reduces stress levels by interacting with the body's receptors to lower cortisol and enhance mood.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces nausea levels by calming the nervous system and easing stomach discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Matricaria chamomilla cream contains flavonoids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Bisabolol, another key constituent, provides soothing effects and helps in reducing skin irritation. Apigenin contributes to the cream's ability to calm skin and may also have anti-cancer properties. Terpinen-4-ol is a powerful antimicrobial compound that supports skin health by combating bacteria and fungi.</p>
<p>Flavonol glycosides further enhance the cream's efficacy by offering additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Matricaria chamomilla cream is primarily made using the flower heads of the plant, which contain the essential oils and active compounds responsible for its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The dried flower heads are the most commonly used part, as they are rich in chamazulene and bisabolol, which have anti-inflammatory and soothing effects. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used in preparations, they are less common in commercial creams compared to the flowers. The roots of Matricaria chamomilla are rarely used in medicinal creams due to their minimal contribution to the active ingredients.</p>
<p>Overall, the flower heads remain the most critical component in the production of effective chamomilla-based creams.</p>
