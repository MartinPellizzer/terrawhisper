The cream may help reduce bleeding, promote healing, and soothe conditions like eczema or insect bites. It is often applied directly to the affected area as part of a holistic approach to skin health.</p>
<p>In traditional herbal practices, it is valued for its ability to support the body's natural healing processes.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium cream relieves pain by soothing inflamed tissues and reducing discomfort associated with various ailments.</p>
<p>It treats wounds by promoting tissue regeneration and preventing further damage through its antimicrobial properties. The cream also treats infections by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi on the skin. Additionally, it reduces inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory agents in the body.</p>
<p>Finally, it can help reduce fever by supporting the body's natural immune response and detoxification processes.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium cream contains phytosterols, which help reduce inflammation and support skin barrier function.</p>
<p>Phenolic acids in the cream act as antioxidants, neutralizing free radicals and protecting the skin from oxidative stress. Flavonoids contribute to the cream's anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, promoting wound healing. Rosmarinic acid enhances the cream's antioxidant capacity and may help alleviate skin irritation.</p>
<p>Apigenin, a flavonoid, further supports skin health by reducing inflammation and potentially inhibiting harmful bacteria.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium cream is commonly made using the dried aerial parts of the plant, including the leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most frequently used component due to their high concentration of essential oils and bioactive compounds. The roots are also sometimes included for their additional therapeutic properties, though they are less commonly used than the leaves. The flowers contribute to the cream's fragrance and may provide some anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Together, these parts are processed to create a soothing and healing topical application.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness and itching, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to a tingling or burning sensation upon application. Some users might experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or swelling. In rare cases, it can cause contact dermatitis.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using the cream regularly.</p>
