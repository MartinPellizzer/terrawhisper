<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense cream reduces inflammation by containing compounds that inhibit inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It fights off bacteria due to its natural antimicrobial properties, making it effective for preventing infections. The cream boosts the immune system by promoting the production of immune cells and enhancing overall body defenses. It eases joint pain by reducing swelling and stiffness, providing relief for conditions like arthritis.</p>
<p>Additionally, it eases skin irritations by soothing redness and promoting skin healing.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense cream contains furanofurane glycosides, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Fucosterol, another key constituent, contributes to the cream’s skin-soothing effects by reducing irritation and promoting healing. Saponins enhance the cream’s ability to penetrate the skin and may help in detoxifying the epidermis. Squalene provides moisturizing benefits by mimicking the skin’s natural oils, improving hydration and elasticity.</p>
<p>Stachydrine acts as a mild stimulant, potentially enhancing circulation and aiding in the overall rejuvenation of the skin.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense cream is commonly made using the plant's rhizomes, which are rich in silica and other bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>The rhizomes are the primary source of the medicinal properties due to their high concentration of essential oils and alkaloids. Additionally, the leaves are sometimes used, as they contain flavonoids that contribute to the cream's anti-inflammatory effects. However, the roots are more frequently utilized because they provide a stronger therapeutic base.</p>
<p>Overall, the rhizomes are the most important part of the Equisetum arvense plant in the production of medicinal creams.</p>
