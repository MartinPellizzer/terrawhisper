<p>Boswellia serrata cream is a topical preparation made from the resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, commonly known as Indian frankincense.</p>
<p>It is widely used in herbalism for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The cream is applied directly to the skin to relieve pain and reduce inflammation associated with conditions like arthritis and muscle strains. It is valued for its natural composition and minimal side effects compared to synthetic medications.</p>
<p>Herbal practitioners often recommend it as a complementary therapy for chronic pain management.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata cream lowers blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and reducing vascular inflammation.</p>
<p>It eases arthritis pain through its anti-inflammatory properties that inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators. The cream also fights osteoarthritis pain by reducing joint swelling and improving mobility. Additionally, it helps reduce inflammation throughout the body, supporting overall joint and tissue health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Boswellia serrata cream may fight anxiety attacks by modulating stress responses and calming the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata cream contains boswellic acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Among these, acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid is particularly effective in inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators. The cream also includes ferulic acid and caffeic acid, both of which act as potent antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals. Quercetin, another key component, contributes to the cream's anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents work synergistically to support skin health and reduce inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Boswella serrata cream is primarily made from the resinous sap, known as frankincense, extracted from the bark of the plant.</p>
<p>The most commonly used part is the inner bark, which contains the active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties. This inner bark is carefully harvested to ensure the highest concentration of boswellic acids. The leaves and roots are also used in some formulations, but they are less common compared to the bark.</p>
<p>The resin is processed into a cream form to enhance its absorption and effectiveness when applied to the skin.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata cream can cause mild skin irritation, such as redness or itching, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to a burning or stinging sensation upon application. Allergic reactions, though rare, can occur and may include rash or hives. Some users might experience dryness or peeling of the skin.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using the cream regularly to identify any adverse reactions.</p>
