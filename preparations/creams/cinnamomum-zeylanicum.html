<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum cream is a topical preparation made from the bark of the cinnamon tree, commonly known as Ceylon cinnamon.</p>
<p>It is used in herbalism for its warming and anti-inflammatory properties. The cream is typically applied to the skin to alleviate muscle pain, joint discomfort, and skin conditions. It is also believed to improve circulation and may help in treating colds and flu when applied externally.</p>
<p>This preparation is valued for its soothing and therapeutic effects in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum cream reduces blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving circulation.</p>
<p>It treats dental infections due to its antimicrobial properties that combat harmful oral bacteria. The cream also reduces inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines in the body. Its soothing effects help relax stress and anxiety, promoting overall mental well-being.</p>
<p>Additionally, regular use may lower the risk of heart disease by supporting cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum cream contains cinnamaldehyde, a key aromatic compound known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It is also rich in sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its therapeutic effects by supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress. Polysaccharides present in the cream help enhance skin hydration and promote wound healing. Additionally, cinnamic acid provides antioxidant benefits, while quercetin, a flavonoid, further supports anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make the cream a valuable ingredient in skincare and therapeutic formulations.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum cream is primarily made using the bark of the tree, which contains the essential oils and active compounds responsible for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The inner bark, known as the cinnamon bark, is the most commonly used part due to its high concentration of cinnamaldehyde and other aromatic compounds. Leaves are also occasionally used, though they contribute less to the overall medicinal potency compared to the bark. Roots are not typically used in the production of cinnamon-based creams.</p>
<p>The essential oils extracted from the bark are the key ingredients that provide the therapeutic benefits in the cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience allergic reactions such as hives or swelling, particularly if they are allergic to cinnamon or related compounds. Prolonged use may lead to skin dryness or peeling due to the essential oils in the cream. In rare cases, it may cause contact dermatitis, which requires discontinuation of the product.</p>
<p>It is advisable to perform a patch test before applying the cream to a larger area of the skin.</p>
