<p>It is used in herbalism to support circulation and may help alleviate symptoms of conditions like peripheral neuropathy or poor blood flow. The cream is typically applied directly to the skin to promote localized healing and reduce inflammation. It is valued for its antioxidant properties and is believed to enhance overall skin health.</p>
<p>This preparation is commonly used in alternative medicine for its potential to improve sensory function and reduce discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba cream reduce inflammation by containing bioactive compounds that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
<p>It also improves memory by enhancing cerebral blood flow and promoting neuroprotective effects. The cream helps regulate blood pressure through its vasodilatory properties, supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, it improves circulation by stimulating the dilation of blood vessels and reducing clot formation.</p>
<p>Lastly, it enhances antioxidant activity, neutralizing free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative stress.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba cream contains phytosterols, which help in reducing inflammation and improving skin health.</p>
<p>It also includes ginkgolides, known for their ability to enhance blood circulation and cognitive function. Flavonoids in the cream act as antioxidants, protecting the skin from oxidative stress. Bilobalide is another key constituent that supports nerve function and may reduce neurodegenerative effects.</p>
<p>Biflavonoids contribute to the cream's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, enhancing overall skin rejuvenation.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba cream typically utilizes the leaves as the primary active ingredient due to their high concentration of flavonoids and terpene lactones, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested during the late summer and early autumn when their biochemical composition is most potent. While the roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, they are less common in modern formulations due to their lower concentration of active compounds. The bark and seeds are occasionally included in some preparations but are not as widely utilized as the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most essential part of the Ginkgo biloba plant in the production of medicinal creams.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba cream can cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Some users may experience allergic reactions such as hives or swelling, particularly if they are allergic to other components in the cream. It may also lead to a tingling or numbing sensation, which is a common side effect of the active ingredients in ginkgo biloba. In rare cases, it can cause gastrointestinal discomfort if absorbed through the skin.</p>
<p>Always perform a patch test before using the cream to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.</p>
