<p>Hypericum perforatum cream is a topical herbal preparation made from the crushed leaves of the St. John's Wort plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in herbalism to treat minor burns, wounds, and skin irritations due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The cream helps to soothe pain and promote healing by reducing inflammation and preventing infection. It is often applied directly to the affected area several times a day.</p>
<p>This preparation is valued for its natural approach to skin care and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum cream relieves depression symptoms by enhancing neurotransmitter activity and promoting serotonin production.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation markers through its anti-inflammatory properties, which help in managing chronic inflammatory conditions. The cream also reduces oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and supporting cellular health. Additionally, it reduces anxiety levels by modulating the nervous system and promoting a calming effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it increases melatonin production, aiding in better sleep quality and overall mood regulation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum cream contains hyperforin, a key bioactive compound known for its antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Quercetin, another prominent constituent, acts as a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Adhyperforin, a derivative of hyperforin, enhances the bioavailability and efficacy of hyperforin in the body. Kaempferol contributes to the cream's antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, supporting skin health.</p>
<p>Hyperoside, a flavonoid, further supports the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions of the cream.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum cream is commonly made using the leaves and flowers of the plant, as these parts contain the highest concentrations of active compounds like hypericin and hyperforin.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested during the summer months when their medicinal properties are most potent. The flowers are also used, especially in formulations that aim to enhance the plant's antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. Roots are generally not used in the preparation of this cream due to their lower potency and less favorable chemical composition.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most valuable parts for creating effective Hypericum perforatum cream.</p>
