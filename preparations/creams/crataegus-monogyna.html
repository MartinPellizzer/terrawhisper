<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Crataegus monogyna cream lower cholesterol by promoting the excretion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.</p>
<p>It reduces inflammation through its antioxidant properties, which help neutralize free radicals and prevent oxidative stress. The cream also lowers blood pressure by improving vascular function and reducing arterial stiffness.

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>

<p>Additionally, the cream includes crataegus monogyna flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin, a powerful flavonoid found in the cream, further supports skin health by neutralizing free radicals and reducing oxidative stress. The cream also contains crataegus monogyna triterpenes, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing effects.</p>
<p>Lastly, ursolic acid, a potent triterpene, enhances the cream's ability to promote skin repair and improve overall skin texture.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Crataegus monogyna cream is commonly made using the leaves, flowers, and berries of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are often harvested during the spring and are known for their antioxidant properties. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are also used due to their anti-inflammatory effects. The berries, rich in flavonoids and vitamin C, contribute to the cream's healing and skin-repairing properties.</p>
<p>These parts are combined to create a natural remedy for skin conditions and inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Crataegus monogyna cream can cause mild skin irritation, including redness, itching, or a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dryness or peeling as the skin adjusts to the herbal formulation. Some users might experience an allergic reaction, such as hives or swelling, if they are allergic to any of the ingredients. In rare cases, it can cause a tingling or numbness sensation due to its active components.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before applying the cream to a larger area of the skin.</p>
