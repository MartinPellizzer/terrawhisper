<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Avena sativa cream reduces stress levels by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system through its soothing properties.</p>
<p>It improves mood stability by supporting emotional balance and reducing feelings of irritability. The cream eases anxiety symptoms by calming the mind and reducing mental fatigue. It enhances cognitive function by improving focus, memory, and mental clarity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces inflammation and pain, offering relief for skin irritations and other inflammatory conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Avena sativa cream contains polyphenols, which are known for their antioxidant properties and ability to reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Avenanthramides, unique to oats, contribute to the cream's anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing effects. Starch in the cream provides a hydrating effect, helping to maintain skin moisture. Lignans, another key component, offer additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Flavonoids further enhance the cream's ability to protect the skin from oxidative stress and promote overall skin health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Avena sativa cream is primarily made using the outer layers of the oat grain, known as the bran, which contains high levels of nutrients and compounds beneficial for the skin.</p>
<p>The leaves of the Avena sativa plant are also used, as they contain silica and antioxidants that help in soothing and repairing the skin. The roots, though less commonly used, contribute to the plant's overall medicinal properties due to their high content of saponins and other bioactive compounds. Additionally, the husk and germ of the oat grain are often included for their moisturizing and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>These parts are carefully processed to extract their beneficial components, resulting in a nourishing and therapeutic cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Avena sativa cream can cause mild skin irritation such as redness, itching, or a burning sensation, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dryness or a tingling sensation as the skin adjusts to the formula. Some users might experience allergic reactions, including hives or swelling, if they are allergic to oat proteins. In rare cases, it can cause contact dermatitis, which is an inflammatory skin reaction.</p>
<p>Overall, these side effects are generally mild and tend to subside with continued use or by discontinuing the product.</p>
