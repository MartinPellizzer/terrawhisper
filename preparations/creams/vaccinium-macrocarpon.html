<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vaccinium macrocarpon cream boosts immune system by enhancing the body's natural defenses through its rich content of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
<p>It eases digestive issues by soothing the gastrointestinal tract and promoting healthy gut flora. The cream fights bacterial infections due to its antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of harmful pathogens. It also fights viral infections by supporting cellular immunity and reducing viral replication.</p>
<p>Additionally, it fights fungal infections by disrupting the cell membranes of fungi, providing comprehensive protection against various pathogens.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vaccinium macrocarpon cream contains epicatechin, a potent antioxidant that supports cardiovascular health and reduces oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Anthocyanin, another key constituent, provides anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective benefits due to its high antioxidant capacity. Tartaric acid contributes to the cream's stability and may also aid in skin hydration and pH balance. Quercetin, a flavonoid, enhances the cream's anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p>
<p>Ellagic acid further supports skin health by promoting cell repair and offering protection against UV-induced damage.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vaccinium macrocarpon cream primarily utilizes the berries of the plant, which are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
<p>The berries are the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of beneficial compounds like tannins and flavonoids. While other parts such as leaves and roots may be used in some formulations, they are less prevalent compared to the berries. The berries are typically harvested, dried, and then processed into a paste or extract for inclusion in the cream.</p>
<p>This makes the berries the most essential component in the preparation of the medicinal cream.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vaccinium macrocarpon cream can cause mild skin irritation, such as redness or a burning sensation, especially in individuals with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dryness or peeling of the skin due to its natural astringent properties. Some users might experience an allergic reaction, including itching or hives, if they are allergic to any of the ingredients. In rare cases, it can cause a tingling or numbness sensation, which is usually temporary.</p>
<p>It is important to perform a patch test before using the cream to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.</p>
