<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or impurities. Place the leaves in a pot and add approximately 500 milliliters of water, then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.</p>
<p>Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the active compounds to dissolve into the water. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to separate the decoction from the plant material, and allow it to cool before use.</p>
