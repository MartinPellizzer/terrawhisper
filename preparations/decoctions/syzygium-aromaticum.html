<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Myrcene contributes to the decoction's calming effects and may aid in reducing stress and improving sleep quality.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Place the cloves in a pot and add the water, then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the cloves.</p>
<p>The resulting decoction can be consumed warm, typically 1-2 times daily, and is often used for its aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Syzygium aromaticum decoction may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain, due to its high concentration of volatile oils.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to clove, manifesting as skin rashes or respiratory issues. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as the compound eugenol has been linked to hepatic damage in some studies. Overconsumption can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure due to its stimulant properties.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
