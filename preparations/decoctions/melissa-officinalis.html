<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis decoction has been used to promote relaxation, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep quality for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Greek and Roman medicine for its calming effects and was often used to treat nervous disorders and insomnia. In traditional herbal practices, it was also employed to support digestive health and alleviate symptoms of colds and fevers. Modern research has validated its anxiolytic properties, leading to its use in herbal remedies and dietary supplements for stress relief.</p>
<p>Today, it remains a popular natural remedy for promoting mental well-being and restful sleep.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>This herbal preparation is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing and therapeutic effects on both the mind and body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
