<p>Its combination of active constituents makes it a valuable herbal remedy for promoting overall wellness and balancing the body's functions.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Paeonia lactiflora decoction, first gather 15-30 grams of dried Paeonia lactiflora root, depending on the desired strength.</p>
<p>Wash the root thoroughly and chop it into small pieces to increase surface area for better extraction. Place the chopped root in a pot and add about 1 liter of water, then bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes, allowing the active compounds to dissolve into the water.</p>
<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any remaining plant material, and the decoction is ready for use.</p>
