<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus decoction has been used to support hormonal balance and menstrual health for centuries, particularly in traditional medicine systems such as Greek, Roman, and European herbal practices.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its ability to regulate menstrual cycles, ease premenstrual symptoms, and support fertility, often referred to as the "chaste tree" due to its association with chastity and reproductive health. In modern times, it is still widely used in herbal medicine to address hormonal imbalances, especially in women experiencing symptoms related to menopause or polycystic ovary syndrome. Scientific studies suggest that compounds in Vitex may influence the pituitary gland and regulate prolactin levels, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
<p>Today, it remains a popular alternative therapy for women's health issues, often used in conjunction with conventional medical treatments.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

The decoction also possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to overall wellness.
