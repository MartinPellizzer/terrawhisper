<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra decoction has been used to treat a variety of ailments throughout history, particularly in traditional European medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its potential to alleviate symptoms of the flu, fever, and respiratory infections, and was often used as a remedy for digestive issues. In traditional practices, it was also employed to reduce inflammation and support immune function. Modern research has explored its antiviral and antioxidant properties, with some studies suggesting it may help in managing viral infections.</p>
<p>However, caution is advised due to potential toxicity if not prepared or consumed properly.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra decoction has health benefits such as boosting the immune system, reducing inflammation, and supporting respiratory health.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used to alleviate symptoms of colds, coughs, and flu due to its antiviral and antioxidant properties. The decoction may also aid in digestion and help manage mild fever. Its compounds, including flavonoids and sambucol, contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution and under professional guidance to avoid potential side effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra decoction active constituents include flavonoids, sambucol, mucilage, and phenolic compounds.</p>
<p>These components contribute to its traditional use in supporting immune function and respiratory health. Flavonoids, such as rutin and quercetin, possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Sambucol, a unique compound found in the berries, is believed to enhance immune response.</p>
<p>Mucilage helps soothe irritated tissues, making the decoction beneficial for conditions like coughs and colds.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Sambucus nigra decoction, begin by gathering 1-2 tablespoons of dried elderberry berries and 4 cups of water.</p>
<p>Place the berries in a pot and add the water, then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors and nutrients to infuse into the water. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the solids.</p>
<p>Allow the decoction to cool slightly before transferring it to a clean container and storing it in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra decoction may lead to gastrointestinal distress, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high concentration of compounds that can irritate the stomach lining.</p>
<p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or even anaphylaxis in severe cases. Long-term use could potentially affect the liver and kidneys, as some studies suggest it may have hepatotoxic properties. There is also a risk of interactions with medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or blood clotting.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for prolonged periods or in high doses.</p>
