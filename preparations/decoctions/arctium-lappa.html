<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Arctium lappa decoction, first gather 15-30 grams of dried Arctium lappa roots, which are typically harvested in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase the surface area for extraction. Place the chopped roots in a pot and add approximately 1 liter of water, then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes, allowing the active compounds to dissolve into the water.</p>
<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and let the decoction cool before use.</p>
