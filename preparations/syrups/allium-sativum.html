<p>In a saucepan, add the garlic slices and 500 ml of water, then bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes to extract the flavor and medicinal properties. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve to remove the garlic pieces.</p>

<p>It can also cause a burning sensation in the throat or stomach, especially if taken on an empty stomach. Some individuals may experience bad breath or body odor as a result of the active sulfur compounds in the syrup. In rare cases, it may interact with blood-thinning medications, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Prolonged use could potentially lead to liver toxicity, so it should be used with caution and under medical supervision.</p>
