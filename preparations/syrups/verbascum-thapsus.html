<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to release their medicinal compounds. Place the chopped leaves in a pot and add water, then bring to a boil and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Finally, combine the strained liquid with sugar in a 1:2 ratio (1 part liquid to 2 parts sugar) and simmer gently until the mixture thickens into a syrup consistency.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Verbascum thapsus syrup may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to its mucilage content.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or respiratory symptoms. Prolonged use may result in digestive issues or interference with nutrient absorption. High doses might lead to hypoglycemia, particularly in diabetic patients.</p>
