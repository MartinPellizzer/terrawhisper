<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Achillea millefolium syrup, first gather fresh or dried yarrow (Achillea millefolium) leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Wash the plant material thoroughly and chop it into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. In a saucepan, combine the chopped yarrow with water and bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant matter.</p>
<p>Finally, mix the infused liquid with honey or sugar syrup to create a thick, herbal syrup that can be stored in a cool, dark place.</p>

<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family, such as ragweed. Long-term use may interfere with blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding. Some studies suggest it may have hepatotoxic effects, though more research is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using this preparation, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p>
