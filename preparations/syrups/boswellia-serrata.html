<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>Grind the resin into a fine powder and place it in a saucepan with a small amount of water. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and let it cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Strain the liquid through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any residue.</p>
<p>Finally, add a sweetener such as honey or maple syrup to taste and let the mixture cool before transferring it to a sterilized bottle for storage.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata syrup may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
