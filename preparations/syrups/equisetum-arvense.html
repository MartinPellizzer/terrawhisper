<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Equisetum arvense syrup, first gather fresh or dried Equisetum arvense (horsetail) plants, ensuring they are free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Wash the plants thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped horsetail in a pot and add water, bringing it to a gentle simmer to create a decoction. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 30 minutes, then strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth.</p>
<p>Finally, combine the liquid with a sugar or honey syrup base and let it cool before storing in a clean, airtight container.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense syrup may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high concentration of compounds like thiamine and other irritants.</p>
<p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Equisetum family. Long-term use could result in liver or kidney damage, as the herb is known to be nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Because of these potential side effects, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation.</p>
