<p>Overall, Cassia auriculata syrup is valued for its natural therapeutic properties in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata syrup active constituents include flavonoids, glycosides, tannins, and essential oils.</p>
<p>These compounds contribute to its therapeutic properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.

<p>Tannins provide astringent properties that can soothe digestive issues and promote wound healing.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cassia auriculata syrup, start by gathering fresh or dried Cassia auriculata flowers, which are known for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Wash the flowers thoroughly and add them to a pot with water, then bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes until the flowers are soft and the liquid has reduced slightly. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the solids, then add sugar to taste and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the syrup into sterilized jars and store it in a cool, dark place.</p>

The syrup may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the digestive system or blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for prolonged periods or in high doses.</p>
