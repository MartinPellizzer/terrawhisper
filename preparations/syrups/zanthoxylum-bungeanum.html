<p>This herbal preparation is often recommended for its ability to support respiratory health and ease coughing.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Zanthoxylum bungeanum syrup active constituents include alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, and phenolic compounds.</p>

<p>Phenolic compounds further support the syrup's role in supporting overall digestive health.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Zanthoxylum bungeanum syrup, start by washing and drying the fresh or dried fruits of the plant.</p>
<p>Next, place the fruits in a pot and add enough water to cover them, then bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes.

<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant family, which includes citrus and other related species. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity, as some components of the syrup can be metabolized into harmful substances. There is also a risk of increased heart rate and hypertension due to the stimulant properties of certain compounds present.</p>
<p>As with any herbal preparation, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with preexisting medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p>
