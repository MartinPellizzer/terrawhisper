<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Salvia miltiorrhiza syrup, start by washing and cutting fresh or dried Salvia miltiorrhiza roots into small pieces.</p>
<p>Place the roots in a pot with enough water to cover them, then bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material. Add honey or a sweetener of choice to the infused liquid and stir until fully dissolved.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the mixture into sterilized bottles and store in a cool, dark place.</p>
