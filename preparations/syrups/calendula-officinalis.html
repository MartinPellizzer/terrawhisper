<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis syrup has been used to treat various skin conditions and digestive issues for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Greece and Rome for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, often applied topically to wounds and burns. In traditional herbal medicine, it was also used to soothe gastrointestinal discomfort and as a mild laxative. Modern applications include its use in topical formulations for eczema, diaper rash, and minor cuts, as well as in oral syrups to support digestive health.</p>
<p>Today, it is widely recognized for its safe profile and continued use in both traditional and complementary medicine practices.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis syrup has health benefits such as soothing inflammation, promoting skin healing, and supporting digestive health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
