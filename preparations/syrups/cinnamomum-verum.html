<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Cinnamomum verum syrup, start by gathering 1 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 cinnamon stick (or 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon).</p>
<p>In a saucepan, combine the water and sugar, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Add the cinnamon stick and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Strain the syrup through a fine mesh strainer to remove the cinnamon stick, then let it cool before transferring it to a clean jar.</p>
<p>This syrup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and used to add flavor to tea, coffee, or desserts.</p>

<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to cinnamon, including skin rashes, itching, or respiratory symptoms. Long-term use may increase the risk of liver damage due to the presence of coumarin, a compound found in cinnamon. In high doses, it may interfere with blood sugar regulation, potentially affecting people with diabetes.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this syrup, especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers, or those on medication.</p>
