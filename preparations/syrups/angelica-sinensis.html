<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in theApiaceae family, such as carrots or celery. Long-term use may interfere with blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly in those on anticoagulant medications. Prolonged consumption might lead to hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may cause liver toxicity in rare cases, so it should be used with caution and under medical supervision.</p>
