<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis syrup has been used to treat eye conditions and respiratory ailments for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional medicine for its purported ability to alleviate symptoms of eye strain, redness, and irritation, as well as to soothe coughs and sore throats. In herbal traditions, it was often prepared as a syrup to make it more palatable and easier to consume, especially for children or those with sensitive stomachs. Modern herbal practitioners continue to use it for its anti-inflammatory and mild expectorant properties, though scientific evidence supporting its efficacy remains limited.</p>
<p>Despite its long history, it is typically used as a complementary therapy rather than a primary treatment in contemporary medicine.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

Boil the mixture to reduce the liquid and concentrate the active compounds, then allow it to cool before bottling. Store the syrup in a cool, dark place to maintain its potency and shelf life.</p>
<p>This preparation is traditionally used to support eye health and relieve symptoms of eye strain or irritation.</p>
