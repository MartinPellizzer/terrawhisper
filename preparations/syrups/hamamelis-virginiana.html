In traditional medicine, it was also used to soothe sore throats and reduce inflammation. Modern applications include its use as a natural remedy for colds, coughs, and minor skin irritations, often found in herbal remedies and over-the-counter products.</p>
<p>Today, it is still valued for its soothing and anti-inflammatory effects, making it a popular choice in alternative and complementary medicine.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>This herbal preparation is often recommended for its natural ability to calm and protect the skin and mucous membranes.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>Store the syrup in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>
