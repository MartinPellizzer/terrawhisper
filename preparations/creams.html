<p>Creams are topical preparations composed of a mixture of water, oil, and emulsifiers, designed to deliver herbal extracts to the skin.</p>
<p>In herbalism, creams are used to apply medicinal herbs directly to the skin for their therapeutic effects. They often contain plant-based ingredients such as aloe vera, calendula, or chamomile, which have soothing and healing properties. These creams are commonly used to treat skin conditions like eczema, burns, or inflammation.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a popular choice for both preventive and therapeutic applications in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2 id="0">What is a cream?</h2>
<p>Creams are semi-solid preparations made by mixing an oil or fat with an aqueous phase, often containing herbal extracts, to create a smooth, spreadable formulation.</p>
<p>Unlike ointments, which are oil-based and more occlusive, creams are water-based and allow for better absorption of active ingredients. They are also different from tinctures or teas, as they are topical applications rather than oral or liquid forms. Creams are particularly effective for delivering herbal compounds to the skin, providing moisturizing and therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Compared to other herbal preparations, creams offer targeted, localized treatment with reduced systemic absorption, making them a versatile and safe option for topical use.</p>

<h2 id="1">How cream works?</h2>
<p>Creams work by delivering active herbal compounds through the skin using a base of water and oil, which allows for both aqueous and lipid-soluble ingredients to be absorbed.</p>
<p>The preparation typically involves extraction methods such as infusion or maceration, where herbs are soaked in a solvent like water, alcohol, or oil to dissolve their active constituents. Common active ingredients include essential oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannins, which are known for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, or analgesic properties. These compounds are then emulsified into a cream base to enhance stability and penetration.</p>
<p>Once applied, the cream allows for controlled absorption through the epidermis, delivering targeted therapeutic effects with varying potency depending on the formulation and skin condition.</p>

<h2 id="2">What are the best herbal creams?</h2>
<p>Some of the best herbal creams for medicinal purposes are Zingiber officinale, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Lavandula angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, and Curcuma longa.</p>
<p>Zingiber officinale, or ginger, is renowned for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. Glycyrrhiza glabra, or licorice root, helps soothe skin irritations and boosts the immune system.</p>
<p>Lavandula angustifolia, or lavender, is prized for its calming and healing effects on the skin. Echinacea purpurea supports the immune system and can reduce the severity of skin infections.</p>
<p>Curcuma longa, or turmeric, is celebrated for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.</p>
