<p>Historically, it was revered in India as a powerful adaptogen, used to support physical and mental resilience during times of stress or fatigue. Traditionally, the juice was prepared from the roots of the plant and consumed to improve sleep, boost immunity, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. In modern times, scientific research has explored its potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, leading to its incorporation in supplements and functional foods.</p>
<p>Today, Withania somnifera juice is increasingly recognized for its role in holistic health and stress management.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>To make Withania somnifera juice, first wash and chop fresh Withania somnifera roots thoroughly.</p>
<p>Next, blend the chopped roots with a small amount of water until a smooth pulp is formed. Strain the pulp through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the solid particles. Then, press the strained pulp to extract the liquid juice.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Withania somnifera juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in high doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause drowsiness and fatigue due to its adaptogenic properties. Long-term use might result in hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting the thyroid and adrenal glands. Some individuals may experience allergic reactions, such as skin rashes or itching.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p>
