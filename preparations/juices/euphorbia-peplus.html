<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Euphorbia peplus juice has been used to treat various skin conditions and ailments for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was employed in traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine to address wounds, inflammation, and skin disorders. In ancient times, the juice was applied topically to reduce swelling and promote healing. Modern research suggests it may have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, leading to its exploration in contemporary dermatological treatments.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, its use is carefully regulated and typically limited to controlled applications under professional supervision.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Euphorbia peplus juice has health benefits such as promoting skin healing, reducing inflammation, and supporting digestive health.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used to treat wounds, eczema, and skin infections due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The juice may also aid in detoxification and help alleviate symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders. Some studies suggest it may have potential in managing diabetes by regulating blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution as it can be toxic if not prepared or applied properly.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Euphorbia peplus juice active constituents include alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins, which contribute to its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>These compounds are known to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial effects. The juice is traditionally used to treat skin conditions such as warts and eczema due to its caustic and drying properties. However, it should be used with caution as it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
<p>Its application is typically limited to external use under professional supervision.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Euphorbia peplus juice, first gather fresh leaves of the plant, making sure to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Using a sharp knife, cut the leaves into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a blender or a mortar and pestle and add a small amount of water or a mild solvent like alcohol.</p>
<p>Blend until a thick, greenish liquid is obtained, then strain through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove plant material.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Euphorbia peplus juice may lead to gastrointestinal irritation, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high concentration of irritant compounds.</p>
<p>It can also cause skin irritation or dermatitis when applied topically, as the juice contains toxic substances like latex and alkaloids. Ingestion of the juice may result in more severe effects such as stomach pain, internal bleeding, or even poisoning. Long-term use or excessive consumption may lead to systemic toxicity, affecting the liver and kidneys.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, as it is not recommended for internal use and can be harmful if misused.</p>
