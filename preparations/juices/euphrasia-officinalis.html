<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis juice has been used to treat eye conditions for centuries, with its historical roots tracing back to ancient herbal medicine practices.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it was valued for its purported ability to alleviate symptoms of eye fatigue, redness, and irritation, often prepared as a tincture or infusion. In modern times, it is still used in some alternative medicine practices, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Today, it is sometimes found in eye drops or herbal formulations aimed at supporting eye health.</p>
<p>However, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy remains limited, and it is generally recommended to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis juice has health benefits such as reducing eye strain, improving vision, and supporting overall eye health.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used to alleviate symptoms of conjunctivitis and other eye irritations due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The juice is also believed to help with fatigue and mental clarity, making it a popular remedy in herbal medicine. It contains antioxidants that may contribute to its soothing effects on the eyes and nervous system.</p>
<p>Due to its mild nature, it is often used in tinctures and eye drops for its calming and restorative properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis juice active constituents include flavonoids, tannins, mucilage, and iridoid glycosides.</p>
<p>These components contribute to its traditional use in supporting eye health and reducing inflammation. The flavonoids act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Tannins and mucilage have a soothing effect on mucous membranes, making it beneficial for conditions like conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>Iridoid glycosides may help in reducing redness and irritation associated with eye fatigue.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Euphrasia officinalis juice, start by harvesting the fresh leaves of the plant during its flowering season, typically in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris, then chop them into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a blender or a juicer and process them until a liquid is obtained. Strain the resulting mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any remaining solids.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Euphrasia officinalis juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, particularly when taken in large doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Scrophulariaceae family. Prolonged use may result in decreased blood pressure and drowsiness due to its mild sedative properties. Overconsumption might lead to more severe symptoms such as headaches and skin rashes.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p>
