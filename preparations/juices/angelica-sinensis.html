<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis juice has been used to support women's health for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its ability to regulate menstrual cycles, alleviate menstrual cramps, and improve fertility. In traditional practices, it was also believed to enhance vitality and promote longevity. Modern research suggests that the juice may contain compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Today, it is used in both traditional and complementary medicine to address hormonal imbalances and support overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It is rich in essential nutrients like iron, calcium, and amino acids, which contribute to its therapeutic properties. This preparation is traditionally used in Chinese medicine to alleviate symptoms of anemia and menstrual disorders. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects may also help in reducing oxidative stress and promoting overall well-being.</p>
<p>Angelica sinensis juice is believed to support hormonal balance and may aid in reducing fatigue and stress.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis juice active constituents include ferulic acid, ligustilide, and adenosine, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Ferulic acid is a potent antioxidant that helps protect cells from oxidative stress. Ligustilide is known for its anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits. Adenosine supports cardiovascular health and may enhance blood flow.</p>
<p>These compounds collectively make Angelica sinensis juice a valuable herbal preparation for promoting overall wellness and addressing various health concerns.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Angelica sinensis juice, first wash and cut the fresh Angelica sinensis roots into small pieces.</p>
<p>Next, blend the root pieces with a small amount of water until a smooth pulp is formed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the solid particles. Then, press the strained pulp to extract as much liquid as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or more severe symptoms. Prolonged use may result in hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content, potentially affecting menstrual cycles and fertility. In some cases, it may interact with medications, particularly blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women and those with existing health conditions.</p>
