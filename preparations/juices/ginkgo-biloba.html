<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba juice has been used to enhance cognitive function and improve circulation for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported ability to clear the mind and promote longevity. In modern times, it is commonly used as a dietary supplement to support memory, concentration, and blood flow. Some studies suggest it may help with conditions like dementia and peripheral vascular disease.</p>
<p>However, its effectiveness remains a topic of debate among scientists and healthcare professionals.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba juice has health benefits such as improving cognitive function, enhancing blood circulation, and reducing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>It contains antioxidants that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. This preparation may support memory and concentration, making it beneficial for individuals experiencing age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, it can promote better blood flow to the brain and extremities, which may help with conditions like dementia or peripheral neuropathy.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba juice, especially for those on medication or with existing health conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba juice active constituents include flavonoids and terpene lactones, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>These compounds help improve blood flow and protect cells from oxidative stress. Flavonoids contribute to the herb's ability to support cognitive function and memory. Terpene lactones are believed to enhance circulation, particularly in the extremities.</p>
<p>Overall, these active constituents make ginkgo biloba juice a popular choice for promoting brain health and overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Ginkgo biloba juice, start by selecting fresh or dried Ginkgo biloba leaves, ensuring they are free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a blender or juicer and add a small amount of water or a mild liquid like almond milk to help with the juicing process. Blend until a smooth liquid is obtained, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any pulp or debris.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours for optimal freshness.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, headaches, and allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
<p>It is derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree and is often used for its purported cognitive and circulatory benefits. However, the juice can interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding. Possible side effects include dizziness, nausea, and skin rashes, especially with high doses.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba juice, particularly for those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
