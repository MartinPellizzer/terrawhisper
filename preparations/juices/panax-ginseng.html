<p>Place the slices in a blender or food processor and add a small amount of water or a liquid such as juice or alcohol to help with blending. Blend until the mixture is smooth, then strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any pulp or residue. Finally, store the prepared juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze it for longer storage.</p>
<p>This preparation is often used for its purported energy-boosting and immune-supporting properties.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng juice may lead to increased heart rate, insomnia, and anxiety in some individuals.</p>

<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
