<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra juice has been used to treat a variety of ailments across different cultures and time periods.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient European medicine for its purported ability to alleviate symptoms of the flu and reduce fever. Traditional uses also included its application for digestive issues and as a remedy for skin conditions. In modern times, it is often consumed as a health tonic and is believed to have antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that its safety and efficacy for medicinal use remain subjects of ongoing research and caution.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra juice has health benefits such as boosting the immune system, reducing inflammation, and supporting cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>It contains antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals in the body, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases. The juice may also aid in respiratory health by alleviating symptoms of colds and flu. Additionally, it has been traditionally used to support liver function and detoxification processes.</p>
<p>However, it should be consumed in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional to avoid potential side effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra juice active constituents include flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and polysaccharides.</p>
<p>These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating properties. Flavonoids help neutralize free radicals, while anthocyanins contribute to the juice's vibrant color and protective effects on cells. Polysaccharides may support immune function and have potential anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>Overall, these constituents make Sambucus nigra juice a valuable herbal preparation for promoting overall health and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Sambucus nigra juice, first gather fresh black elderberries, making sure they are fully ripe and free from any signs of mold or rot.</p>
<p>Wash the berries thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Next, blend the cleaned berries with a small amount of water or a mild acidic liquid like lemon juice to help break them down and extract the juice. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the pulp and seeds.</p>
<p>Finally, press the strained mixture to extract as much juice as possible, and store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high concentration of compounds that can irritate the stomach lining.</p>
<p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as skin rashes, itching, or respiratory symptoms. Long-term use could interfere with liver function, as some studies suggest potential hepatotoxicity from prolonged consumption. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Sambucus nigra juice, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
