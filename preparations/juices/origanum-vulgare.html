<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Origanum vulgare juice, first, select fresh or dried oregano leaves, ensuring they are free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly and chop them finely to release their essential oils. Place the chopped leaves in a blender or juicer and add a small amount of water or a neutral liquid to help with extraction. Blend until a smooth liquid is obtained, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any solid particles.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Origanum vulgare juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Lamiaceae family, such as mint or sage. Prolonged use may interfere with certain medications, particularly those affecting the liver or blood clotting. In high doses, it may contribute to liver toxicity or damage.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for pregnant women or those with existing medical conditions.</p>
