In modern times, research has highlighted its potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, leading to its use in dietary supplements and functional foods. The juice is also believed to aid in detoxification and may support liver function.</p>
<p>Today, it continues to be a popular remedy in both traditional and complementary medicine practices worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Next, cut the fruit into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the pieces in a blender and add a small amount of water or a liquid such as coconut water to help with blending. Blend until a smooth pulp is obtained, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to separate the juice from the pulp.</p>
<p>Finally, store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<p>Terminalia chebula juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in high doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant's compounds. Prolonged use may result in liver toxicity due to the presence of certain alkaloids and tannins. Additionally, it may interact with medications, particularly those affecting the kidneys or blood pressure.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Terminalia chebula juice, especially for long-term or therapeutic purposes.</p>
