<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Hamamelis virginiana juice, first gather fresh Hamamelis virginiana leaves and flowers, ensuring they are clean and free from pesticides.</p>
<p>Next, wash the plant material thoroughly and chop it into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves and flowers in a blender or food processor and add a small amount of water or a mild alcohol solution, such as vodka or brandy, to help extract the active compounds. Blend until a thick, pulpy mixture is formed, then strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove solid particles.</p>
<p>Allow the strained juice to sit for a few hours to settle, then transfer the liquid to a clean container and store it in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>

In rare cases, it may contribute to liver toxicity, especially when consumed in large amounts or over extended periods.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this preparation, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
