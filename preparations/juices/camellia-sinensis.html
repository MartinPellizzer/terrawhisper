<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining solids, and serve chilled or at room temperature.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Camellia sinensis juice may lead to increased alertness and a temporary boost in energy due to its caffeine content.</p>
<p>It is commonly consumed for its potential antioxidant properties and may support digestive health.
