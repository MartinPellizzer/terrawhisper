<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata juice has been used to treat inflammation and pain for thousands of years, originating from ancient Ayurvedic traditions in India.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it was used to alleviate joint pain, digestive issues, and respiratory conditions, often prepared as a resin or extract. In modern times, it is widely recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in supplements to support joint health and reduce inflammation.

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata juice has health benefits such as reducing inflammation and supporting joint health.</p>

<p>Boswellia serrata juice is often used as a natural remedy to promote overall wellness and mobility.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata juice active constituents include boswellic acids, terpenoids, and flavonoids, which contribute to its therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>These compounds work by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as 5-lipoxygenase, thereby reducing inflammation and pain.

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Boswellia serrata juice, start by selecting fresh or dried Boswellia serrata resin, also known as frankincense.</p>
<p>Wash the resin thoroughly to remove any impurities, then place it in a blender or food processor. Add a small amount of water or a neutral liquid like coconut water to help with grinding. Blend until the resin is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.</p>
<p>Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining solids, and then store the juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata juice may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain, especially at higher doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in some individuals, such as skin rashes or itching. The preparation may interact with certain medications, particularly blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding. Long-term use might lead to liver enzyme changes, though this is rare.</p>
