In modern times, it is still used in skincare products and herbal remedies for its gentle exfoliating and soothing effects.</p>
<p>Its historical and traditional use continues to influence its application in alternative and complementary medicine today.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>To make Saponaria officinalis juice, start by harvesting the fresh leaves of the plant during its flowering period, typically in early summer.</p>
<p>Wash the leaves thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. Place the leaves in a blender and add a small amount of water or a mild acidic liquid like lemon juice to help extract the juice. Blend until a smooth, green liquid is obtained, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove pulp and solid particles.</p>
<p>The resulting juice can be used topically or internally, depending on the intended use, and should be consumed or applied promptly for best results.</p>
