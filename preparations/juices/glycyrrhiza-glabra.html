<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Glycyrrhiza glabra juice, start by selecting fresh or dried roots of the licorice plant.</p>
<p>Wash the roots thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. Place the chopped roots in a pot and add enough water to cover them by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and collect the juice for use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra juice may lead to increased blood pressure, sodium retention, and potassium loss due to its high content of glycyrrhizin.</p>
<p>Prolonged use can result in pseudoaldosteronism, which may cause symptoms such as swelling, headaches, and in severe cases, heart failure. It can also disrupt the balance of electrolytes in the body, leading to muscle weakness and cramps. Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular system or corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Individuals with hypertension or those on medication should consult a healthcare provider before using this preparation.</p>
