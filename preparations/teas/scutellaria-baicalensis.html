<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tea has anti oxidant properties that help neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress in the body.</p>
<p>It also possesses anti bacterial effects, which can help combat harmful pathogens and support overall hygiene. This tea supports the immune system by enhancing the body's natural defenses against infections and illnesses. Additionally, it contains compounds that isolate anti inflammatory properties, reducing inflammation and promoting cellular health.</p>
<p>Finally, it supports liver detoxification by aiding in the elimination of toxins and improving liver function.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tea contains baicalein, a potent flavonoid known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Alongside baicalein, the tea also contains baicalin, which is a glycoside derivative of baicalein and exhibits similar bioactivities. Polysaccharides in the tea contribute to immune modulation and gut health by promoting beneficial microbial activity. Flavonoids, a broader class of compounds present in the tea, offer additional protection against oxidative stress and chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Wogonin, another key constituent, has shown potential in cancer prevention and neuroprotective effects due to its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tea is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain high concentrations of active compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part due to their potent medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. While the leaves may be used in some preparations, they are less common compared to the roots. The flowers are occasionally included for additional aromatic and therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the roots remain the most essential component in traditional and modern formulations of Scutellaria baicalensis tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Scutellaria baicalensis tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes, itching, or hives, especially in people sensitive to plants in the Scrophulariaceae family. Long-term or high-dose consumption might result in liver toxicity, though this is rare. Some users may experience dizziness or headaches due to its mild sedative properties.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this tea, particularly for those with pre-existing medical conditions or on medication.</p>
