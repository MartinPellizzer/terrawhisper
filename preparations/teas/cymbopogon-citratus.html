<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tea reduces inflammation by containing compounds like limonene and myrcene, which have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system due to its high concentration of antioxidants, which help neutralize free radicals in the body. The tea can relieve joint pain by reducing swelling and discomfort associated with conditions like arthritis. It eases digestion issues by promoting the production of digestive enzymes and reducing bloating.</p>
<p>Additionally, it lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and improving circulation.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tea contains citral, which is a major contributor to its characteristic lemon scent and has shown antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Limonene and d-limonene are also present, both contributing to the tea's aroma and exhibiting potential antioxidant and anti-cancer effects. Geraniol, another key constituent, is known for its antimicrobial activity and may help in reducing oxidative stress. Linalool, a terpene alcohol, contributes to the tea's calming effects and has been linked to anxiety reduction and improved sleep.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive compounds make Cymbopogon citratus tea a valuable natural remedy with diverse therapeutic benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cymbopogon citratus tea is primarily made from the leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain high concentrations of essential oils, including citral, which contribute to the tea's distinctive scent and therapeutic effects. While the roots of the plant are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the leaves. The stems may be used alongside the leaves to enhance the flavor and potency of the tea.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves are the most essential component in the preparation of Cymbopogon citratus tea.</p>
