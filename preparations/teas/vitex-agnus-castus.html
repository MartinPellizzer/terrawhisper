<p>Vitex agnus-castus tea is made from the dried flowers of the chasteberry plant, which has been used for centuries in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to support hormonal balance, particularly in women, to alleviate symptoms related to menstruation, PMS, and menopause. The tea is believed to influence the pituitary gland and regulate the production of hormones like prolactin and estrogen. It is often prepared by steeping the dried flowers in hot water for several minutes.</p>
<p>In herbalism, it is also used to address issues such as irregular menstrual cycles and emotional symptoms associated with hormonal fluctuations.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus tea regulates menstrual cycles by influencing the pituitary gland's production of luteinizing hormone, which helps synchronize the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>It improves libido levels by promoting the production of sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone. This herb alleviates infertility by supporting the proper development of follicles and enhancing ovulation. Additionally, it supports hormone balance by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.</p>
<p>Lastly, it reduces androgen excess, making it beneficial for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus tea contains diterpenes, which are known for their potential anti-inflammatory and hormonal regulatory properties.</p>
<p>Among these, vitexicarpin is a key bioactive compound that may support reproductive health by influencing hormone levels. Agnuside, another constituent, contributes to the tea's antioxidant and antispasmodic effects. Flavonoids present in the tea act as powerful antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, phenolic acids provide further antioxidant support and may aid in reducing inflammation and improving overall metabolic function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus tea is primarily made from the dried flowers of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The flowers are harvested when they are fully open and have a rich, aromatic scent. They are often dried and then steeped in hot water to create the tea, which is known for its potential hormonal balancing effects. While leaves and seeds are sometimes used in traditional preparations, they are less common than the flowers.</p>
<p>The roots of the plant are rarely used in tea-making due to their limited medicinal profile compared to the flowers.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, and stomach cramps in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to hormonal fluctuations, resulting in mood swings or changes in menstrual patterns. Headaches and fatigue are additional side effects that some people experience. In rare cases, it may cause skin rashes or allergic reactions.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
