<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea has been used to treat a variety of ailments for thousands of years, with roots in ancient Greek and European herbal traditions.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its ability to promote wound healing and reduce inflammation, earning it the name "nose-leek" due to its use in treating nosebleeds. Traditionally, it was also used to alleviate digestive issues, menstrual discomfort, and as a general tonic for overall health. In modern times, it continues to be used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, supporting skin health and immune function.</p>
<p>Today, it is commonly found in herbal remedies and is often recommended for its calming and digestive benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea has health benefits such as reducing inflammation, supporting digestive health, and promoting skin healing.</p>
<p>It is known for its antioxidant properties that may help protect cells from damage. This herbal tea is often used to alleviate symptoms of menstrual cramps and menopause due to its mild sedative effects. Additionally, it may aid in liver function and help with detoxification processes in the body.</p>
<p>Its calming properties can also contribute to stress relief and improved mental well-being.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea active constituents include sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids, and volatile oils.</p>
<p>These compounds are responsible for the plant's anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Sesquiterpene lactones contribute to its ability to reduce inflammation and support wound healing. Flavonoids help protect cells from oxidative stress and may support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Volatile oils provide a calming effect and can aid in digestion and respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Achillea millefolium tea, begin by gathering fresh or dried yarrow leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Wash the herbs thoroughly and place them in a heat-resistant container. Pour boiling water over the herbs and let the mixture steep for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the liquid to remove the plant material, and serve the tea warm.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation is known for its calming and digestive benefits.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large quantities or on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>It may also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family, such as ragweed. Prolonged use could potentially interfere with blood clotting, increasing the risk of bleeding. High doses might lead to liver toxicity in some cases, although this is rare.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using this tea, particularly for pregnant women, nursing mothers, or those taking medications.</p>
