<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea relieves pain by containing compounds that act as natural analgesics, helping to ease both acute and chronic discomfort.</p>
<p>It treats wounds by promoting tissue repair and preventing infection due to its antimicrobial properties. The tea also treats infections by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other pathogens. It reduces inflammation through its anti-inflammatory compounds, which can alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea millefolium tea reduces fever by supporting the body's immune response and helping to lower body temperature.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea contains phytosterols, which help reduce cholesterol absorption and support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>It also includes phenolic acids, known for their antioxidant properties that combat oxidative stress. The tea is rich in flavonoids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Rosmarinic acid is another key component, offering antimicrobial and antiviral benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, apigenin, a flavone, has been linked to improved cognitive function and reduced cancer risk.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea is primarily made from the dried leaves and flowers of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part, as they contain high levels of essential oils and compounds like chamazulene. The flowers, especially the blue ones, are also used to add color and additional therapeutic properties to the tea. Roots are occasionally used but are less common due to their lower concentration of active compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most valued components for their medicinal benefits.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially in people sensitive to plants in the Asteraceae family. In higher doses, it can potentially affect the liver, though this is rare and more commonly associated with long-term use. Some users may experience headaches or dizziness as secondary side effects.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using this tea, particularly for pregnant or breastfeeding women and those on medication.</p>
