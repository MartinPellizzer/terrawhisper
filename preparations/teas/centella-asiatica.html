<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tea improves skin texture by promoting collagen production and enhancing skin elasticity, leading to a smoother and more radiant complexion.</p>
<p>It protects against oxidation due to its high concentration of antioxidants, which neutralize free radicals and reduce cellular damage. This herb supports wound healing by stimulating the synthesis of collagen and promoting tissue regeneration. Additionally, Centella asiatica tea boosts brain function and enhances cognitive power by improving blood circulation and reducing mental fatigue.</p>
<p>Its holistic benefits make it a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tea contains triterpenoid glycosides, which are known for their ability to promote skin healing and enhance wound repair.</p>
<p>These compounds also include triterpenoid saponins, which contribute to the tea's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Asiatic acid, another key constituent, supports collagen synthesis and may improve skin elasticity. Madecassoside, a major triterpenoid, is renowned for its role in reducing scarring and enhancing cellular regeneration.</p>
<p>Additionally, triterpene esters present in the tea help in maintaining skin integrity and supporting overall skin health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Centella asiatica tea is primarily made from the leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of active compounds like asiatic acid and madecassol.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested when they are young and tender to ensure maximum potency and flavor. While the roots are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the leaves. The stems may be included in certain formulations, but they are usually secondary to the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most essential component in the preparation of Centella asiatica tea for its medicinal benefits.</p>
