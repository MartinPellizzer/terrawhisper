<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Camellia sinensis tea eat antioxidants that help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, promoting overall cellular health.</p>
<p>It has been shown to lower blood pressure by improving vascular function and reducing arterial stiffness. The tea also improves heart health by lowering cholesterol levels and enhancing blood flow. Its anti-inflammatory properties can help reduce chronic inflammation linked to various diseases.</p>
<p>Additionally, Camellia sinensis tea reduces oxidative stress, which is a key factor in aging and the development of chronic illnesses.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Camellia sinensis tea contains theaflavin, a polyphenolic compound known for its antioxidant properties and potential to reduce cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Thearubigin, another key constituent, contributes to the tea's color and has been linked to cardiovascular benefits. Catechin, a type of flavonoid, is renowned for its ability to support metabolic health and enhance fat oxidation. Epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are also present, with EGCG being particularly noted for its strong antioxidant effects and potential anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents play a significant role in the health benefits associated with regular tea consumption.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Camellia sinensis tea is primarily made from the leaves and buds of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for producing various types of tea.</p>
<p>The leaves, especially the tender ones, are harvested and processed to create green, black, oolong, and white teas, each with distinct flavors and health benefits. While the roots of Camellia sinensis are occasionally used in traditional medicine, they are not as prevalent as the leaves in tea production. The stems and twigs are sometimes included in certain tea blends but are less common than the leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and buds remain the most essential and widely utilized components of the Camellia sinensis plant for making medicinal and non-medicinal teas.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Camellia sinensis tea can cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, stomach cramps, or diarrhea, especially when consumed on an empty stomach or in large quantities.</p>
<p>It may also lead to sleep disturbances due to its caffeine content, which can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Some individuals may experience increased heart rate or anxiety as a result of the stimulant effects of caffeine present in the tea. Long-term or excessive consumption might contribute to dependency or tolerance to caffeine, similar to that of coffee.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, so it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before regular use.</p>
