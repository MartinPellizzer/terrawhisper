<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Valeriana officinalis tea has been used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in ancient Greek and Roman medicine for its calming effects, often used to treat nervous disorders and insomnia. In traditional herbal practices, it was also employed to alleviate anxiety, headaches, and muscle spasms. Modern research supports its use as a natural remedy for stress-related conditions and sleep disorders, with its active compounds believed to enhance GABA activity in the brain.</p>
<p>Today, it remains a popular choice for those seeking a gentle, non-addictive alternative to pharmaceutical sedatives.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Valeriana officinalis tea has health benefits such as promoting relaxation, improving sleep quality, and reducing anxiety.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of insomnia and nervous tension due to its sedative properties. The tea contains compounds like valerenic acid, which may help regulate the nervous system. It is also believed to support digestive health and reduce muscle spasms.</p>
<p>However, it should be consumed in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Valeriana officinalis tea active constituents include valerenic acid, valeramide, and various volatile oils, which contribute to its calming effects.</p>
