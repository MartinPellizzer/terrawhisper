<p>It also relieves joint pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties that reduce swelling and stiffness in the joints.

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>

<p>β-carophyllene contributes to the tea's aromatic profile and may possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. α-pinene and β-pinene are monoterpene compounds that provide the tea with a fresh, pine-like scent and may support respiratory health. Limonene, another monoterpene, adds a citrusy aroma and is associated with potential anti-cancer and antioxidant benefits.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents contribute to the therapeutic and sensory qualities of Piper nigrum tea.</p>

<p>Piper nigrum tea is primarily made from the dried berries, known as black pepper, which are the most commonly used part of the plant for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The berries contain essential oils, piperine, and other bioactive compounds that contribute to its therapeutic properties. While the leaves of the Piper nigrum plant are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common than the berries. The roots and stems are occasionally used in herbal formulations but are not as prevalent as the berries or leaves.</p>
<p>Overall, the berries remain the most significant and widely utilized part of the Piper nigrum plant in the preparation of medicinal tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Piper nigrum tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to heartburn or acid reflux due to its stimulating properties. Some people might experience insomnia or restlessness because of the caffeine content present in black pepper. In rare cases, excessive consumption could result in increased heart rate or anxiety.</p>
<p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using this tea, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
