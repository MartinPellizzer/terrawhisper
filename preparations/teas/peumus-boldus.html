<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Peumus boldus tea relieves constipation by stimulating digestive functions and promoting regular bowel movements.</p>
<p>It also heals skin issues due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that reduce acne and irritation. This tea boosts energy levels by enhancing metabolic processes and improving overall vitality. Additionally, it cures respiratory issues by acting as a natural decongestant and soothing inflammation in the airways.</p>
<p>Lastly, Peumus boldus tea treats anxiety by calming the nervous system and reducing stress-related symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Peumus boldus tea contains alkaloid boldine, which is known for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>It also includes polyphenols, which act as antioxidants and may support cardiovascular health. Quercetin, a flavonoid found in the tea, contributes to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. Additionally, the tea contains terpenes, which are responsible for its aromatic profile and may have calming and digestive benefits.</p>
<p>Finally, flavonoids in Peumus boldus tea contribute to its overall antioxidant capacity and may support immune function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Peumus boldus tea is traditionally made using the leaves and flowers of the plant, which are the most commonly utilized parts for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested when they are young and tender, as they contain the highest concentration of active compounds. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are also used to add a mild flavor and additional therapeutic benefits. While the roots are sometimes used in some traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the primary components in the preparation of Peumus boldus tea.</p>
