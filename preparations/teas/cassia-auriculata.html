<p>Cassia auriculata tea is a traditional herbal preparation made from the dried flowers of the Cassia auriculata plant, commonly known as the "golden shower" tree.</p>
<p>This tea is used in herbalism to support digestive health and has mild laxative properties. It is often consumed to relieve constipation and promote regular bowel movements. The tea may also help reduce inflammation and is sometimes used in skincare for its soothing effects.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it is valued for its ability to balance internal body functions and support overall wellness.</p>

<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata tea is primarily made using the leaves, which are the most commonly used part of the plant due to their high concentration of bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested when they are young and tender, as they contain the highest levels of flavonoids and essential oils. In some traditional preparations, the flowers are also used, adding a subtle aroma and additional medicinal properties. The roots, though less frequently used, are sometimes incorporated for their potential anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most significant component in the preparation of Cassia auriculata tea for its therapeutic benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cassia auriculata tea can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high content of compounds like sennoside A, which acts as a natural laxative.</p>
<p>It may also lead to dehydration as a result of increased bowel movements, especially if consumed in large quantities. Some individuals may experience allergic reactions such as skin rashes or itching, particularly if they are sensitive to plants in the legume family. Long-term use could result in electrolyte imbalances or dependency on the laxative effects, leading to reduced bowel function over time.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this tea, especially for those with pre-existing digestive conditions.</p>
