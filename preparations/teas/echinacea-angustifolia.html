<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia tea boosts immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells, which are essential for fighting off pathogens.</p>
<p>It eases respiratory issues by reducing mucus production and soothing irritated airways, making it beneficial for conditions like bronchitis and the common cold. This tea reduces inflammation quickly due to its anti-inflammatory compounds, which can help alleviate symptoms of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It fights viral infections by enhancing the body's natural defenses, making it a popular remedy during flu season.</p>
<p>Additionally, Echinacea angustifolia tea fights infections fast, thanks to its antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria and viruses.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia tea contains lipopolysaccharides, which are known for their immunostimulatory properties and ability to enhance the body's response to infections.</p>
<p>Echinacoside, another key constituent, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress. Alkaloids present in the tea contribute to its antimicrobial and antiviral activities, helping to combat various pathogens. Kaempferol and quercetin, both flavonoids, provide additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, further bolstering the tea's therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive compounds make Echinacea angustifolia tea a valuable herbal remedy for supporting immune health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia tea is primarily made from the roots and leaves of the plant.</p>
<p>The roots are the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of active compounds like alkamides and polysaccharides. Leaves are also utilized, especially in formulations that aim to support immune function. Both parts are typically dried and ground into a powder or used whole in tea preparations.</p>
<p>The flowers are occasionally included but are less common compared to roots and leaves.</p>
