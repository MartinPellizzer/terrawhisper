<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Echinacea angustifolia tea has been used to support immune health and treat respiratory infections for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, Native American tribes such as the Plains Indians used echinacea for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, often preparing it as a tea to alleviate colds and sore throats. In traditional medicine, it was also used to treat skin infections and wounds due to its ability to promote healing. Modern research suggests that echinacea may help reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms, making it a popular herbal remedy today.</p>
<p>However, its effectiveness can vary, and it is often recommended to consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>

<p>It is best consumed up to three times a day, depending on individual needs and guidance from a healthcare provider.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
