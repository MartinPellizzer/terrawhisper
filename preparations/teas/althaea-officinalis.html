<p>Althaea officinalis tea is a herbal preparation made from the dried leaves and flowers of the marshmallow plant.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbalism for its soothing and demulcent properties. This tea is often consumed to alleviate symptoms of respiratory conditions such as coughs and sore throats. It can also be used to ease digestive discomfort and promote overall comfort in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Its mild and calming effects make it a popular remedy for minor ailments and as a general tonic.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis tea treat mouth ulcers by soothing the oral mucosa and reducing inflammation due to its high mucilage content.</p>
<p>It can also treat gum disease by promoting healing and reducing bacterial buildup in the mouth. The tea helps relieve skin itch through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that calm irritated skin. It is effective in treating vaginal itch by balancing the pH and reducing fungal or bacterial infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, Althaea officinalis tea can reduce menstrual pain by acting as a natural antispasmodic and easing cramping.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis tea contains mucilages, which are complex mixtures of polysaccharides and glycoproteins that form a gel-like substance when mixed with water, providing soothing effects on the digestive tract.</p>
<p>These mucilages also contribute to the tea's ability to act as a demulcent, helping to alleviate irritation and inflammation in the throat and stomach. In addition to mucilages, the tea contains various polysaccharides, which are known for their immune-boosting properties and ability to support gut health. Starch and sugars such as galactose and glucose are also present, contributing to the tea's mild sweetness and providing a source of energy.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive constituents make Althaea officinalis tea beneficial for digestive and respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis tea is primarily made from the roots and leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The roots are often dried and ground into a powder or used as a base for the tea due to their high mucilage content. The leaves, while less commonly used, can also be harvested and dried for infusion. Both the roots and leaves are valued for their soothing properties and ability to aid in respiratory and digestive health.</p>
<p>These parts are carefully processed to preserve their therapeutic compounds and ensure a safe, effective herbal remedy.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Althaea officinalis tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as bloating, gas, and mild stomach cramps, especially when consumed in large amounts.</p>
<p>It may also lead to a decrease in blood pressure, which can be problematic for individuals with hypotension. Some people may experience allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, due to sensitivity to the plant's compounds. Long-term use might result in dependency or reduced effectiveness of certain medications, so it should be used with caution.</p>
<p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before regular consumption.</p>
