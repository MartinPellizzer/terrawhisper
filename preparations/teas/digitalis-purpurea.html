<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Digitalis purpurea tea has been used to treat heart conditions for centuries, with its medicinal properties traced back to ancient Greek and Roman herbal traditions.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its ability to strengthen heart contractions and was used to manage ailments such as dropsy, a term now understood as edema. In traditional medicine, it was often prepared as a tea or tincture and administered to patients with cardiovascular disorders. Modern pharmacology has refined its use, with purified forms of its active compounds, such as digoxin, now prescribed for heart failure and arrhythmias.</p>
<p>However, due to its potent effects, Digitalis purpurea tea is no longer recommended for general use without professional supervision.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It contains compounds like cardiac glycosides that can help regulate heart rhythm and strengthen cardiac muscle contractions. This tea may also aid in reducing swelling and improving kidney function due to its diuretic properties. However, it should be used with caution as it can be toxic in high doses.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular and diuretic effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Digitalis purpurea tea active constituents include cardiac glycosides such as digoxin and digitoxin, which are known for their potent effects on the heart.</p>

<p>Measure approximately 1 teaspoon of the dried herb and place it in a heatproof container. Pour about 8 ounces of boiling water over the herb and let it steep for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the liquid to remove the plant material, and drink the tea while it is still warm.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Digitalis purpurea is a potent herb and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional due to its potential toxicity.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Digitalis purpurea tea may lead to serious side effects due to its potent cardiac glycoside content, which can affect the heart's rhythm and function.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used for its ability to strengthen heart contractions and regulate heart rate, but its use requires careful monitoring. Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. Overdose can result in toxicity, leading to symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision, and even cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Due to these risks, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using Digitalis purpurea tea.</p>
