<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Taraxacum officinale tea reduces inflammation by containing compounds like sesquiterpene lactones, which help suppress inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system through its high concentration of antioxidants and vitamins, such as vitamin C and E, which protect cells from damage. The tea also soothes digestive issues by promoting the production of digestive enzymes and reducing gut inflammation. Additionally, it can help soothe eye inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties that may alleviate symptoms like redness and irritation.</p>
<p>Some studies suggest that Taraxacum officinale tea may fight cancer cells by inhibiting their growth and promoting apoptosis.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Taraxacum officinale tea contains inulin, a prebiotic fiber that supports gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria.</p>
<p>It also includes luteolin, a flavonoid with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The tea is rich in terpenoids, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste and possess various pharmacological activities. Flavonoids in the tea, such as quercetin and apigenin, further enhance its antioxidant capacity and may support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Additionally, sesquiterpenes present in the tea have been linked to anti-cancer and immune-modulating effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Taraxacum officinale tea is primarily made from the leaves and roots of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are commonly used due to their mild bitterness and high content of beneficial compounds like inulin. The roots are also utilized, especially for their stronger, more earthy flavor and higher concentration of medicinal properties. Both parts are often dried and steeped in hot water to create the tea.</p>
<p>These components are valued for their potential health benefits, including digestive support and immune system enhancement.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Taraxacum officinale tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to increased urination due to its diuretic properties. Some people might experience allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching. Long-term use could potentially interfere with certain medications, especially those affecting the kidneys or liver.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this tea, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
