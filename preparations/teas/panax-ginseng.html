<p>Panax ginseng tea is a traditional herbal preparation made from the dried roots of the Panax ginseng plant, commonly known as ginseng.</p>
<p>It is brewed by steeping the dried root in hot water, creating a flavorful and aromatic beverage. In herbalism, this tea is used to enhance energy, reduce stress, and support cognitive function. It is often prescribed for its adaptogenic properties, which help the body resist stress and maintain balance.</p>
<p>Panax ginseng tea is valued in both traditional Chinese medicine and modern wellness practices for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng tea boosts energy levels by increasing the production of ATP in cells, which enhances physical and mental stamina.</p>
<p>It improves cognitive function by promoting blood flow to the brain and supporting neurotransmitter activity, leading to better focus and memory. The tea reduces inflammation through its active compounds, such as ginsenosides, which have anti-inflammatory properties that may help with chronic conditions. It supports the immune system by stimulating the production of immune cells and enhancing the body's defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>Additionally, Panax ginseng tea reduces anxiety symptoms by regulating stress hormones like cortisol and promoting a sense of calm.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng tea contains ginsenosides, which are the primary bioactive compounds responsible for its adaptogenic and pharmacological effects.</p>
<p>These ginsenosides, including compounds like Rg1 and Re, are known to support cognitive function, reduce stress, and enhance physical performance. In addition to ginsenosides, the tea also contains polysaccharides that contribute to immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties. Triterpenoids and saponins present in the tea further support cardiovascular health and may have anti-cancer properties.</p>
<p>Terpenoids, another group of compounds, are involved in the tea's antioxidant and neuroprotective benefits.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng tea is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which are the most valued and commonly used part for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The roots contain the active compounds, such as ginsenosides, that are responsible for the plant's health benefits. While leaves and stems can also be used in some preparations, they are less common compared to the roots. The roots are typically dried and sliced before being used to make tea, either by steeping or boiling.</p>
<p>This makes the roots the most essential component in the preparation of Panax ginseng tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Panax ginseng tea can cause insomnia or difficulty sleeping due to its stimulating properties.</p>
<p>It may also lead to digestive issues such as nausea, stomach upset, or heartburn in some individuals. Headaches and increased heart rate are additional side effects that have been reported. In rare cases, it may contribute to anxiety or restlessness, especially when consumed in large amounts.</p>
<p>Long-term use could potentially interfere with certain medications or hormonal balances.</p>
