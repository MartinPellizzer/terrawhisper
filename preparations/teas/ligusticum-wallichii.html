<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ligusticum wallichii tea is primarily made from the roots and rhizomes of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>These underground portions contain high concentrations of essential oils and bioactive compounds that contribute to the tea's therapeutic properties. The roots are typically dried and ground into a powder before being steeped in hot water to extract their beneficial compounds. In traditional medicine, the roots are valued for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, making them a key ingredient in the preparation of the tea.</p>
<p>While leaves and other parts may be used in some formulations, the roots remain the most significant and widely utilized component.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ligusticum wallichii tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially in people sensitive to related plants. Headaches and dizziness are occasionally reported as side effects, possibly due to its active compounds affecting blood flow. Long-term use might result in liver toxicity, although this is rare and more commonly associated with high doses or prolonged consumption.</p>
