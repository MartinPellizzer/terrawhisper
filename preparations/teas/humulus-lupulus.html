<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus tea relaxes nervous system by promoting a calming effect on the body, which can help alleviate tension and foster a sense of tranquility.</p>
<p>It relieves anxiety symptoms through its natural compounds that interact with the brain's neurotransmitters, reducing feelings of worry and unease. This tea also reduces stress hormones like cortisol, helping the body manage stress more effectively. Additionally, it has anti-inflammatory properties that can support overall bodily health and reduce chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>Finally, Humulus lupulus tea improves sleep quality by promoting relaxation and regulating the sleep-wake cycle.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus tea contains xanthohumol, a prenylated flavonoid known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alongside xanthohumol, the tea also includes humulone, a bitter compound that acts as a natural preservative and may have antimicrobial effects. Lupulone, another key constituent, contributes to the tea's bitterness and has been studied for its potential anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory benefits. Hesperidin, a flavonoid glycoside, supports cardiovascular health and enhances the bioavailability of other compounds.</p>
<p>Finally, kaempferol, a flavonol, exhibits strong antioxidant activity and may help in reducing oxidative stress in the body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Humulus lupulus tea, commonly known as hop tea, is primarily made from the cone-shaped flowers of the Humulus lupulus plant.</p>
<p>These flowers, called hop cones, are the most commonly used part for making the tea due to their high concentration of compounds like humulone and lupuline. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional preparations, they are less common compared to the hop cones. The roots of the plant are rarely used in medicinal teas, as they contain fewer active compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the hop cones are the most essential and widely utilized part of the plant in the preparation of this type of tea.</p>
