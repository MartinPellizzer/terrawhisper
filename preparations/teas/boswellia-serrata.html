<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata tea lowers blood pressure by promoting cardiovascular health and reducing stress-related hypertension.</p>
<p>It also eases arthritis pain and fights osteoarthritis pain through its anti-inflammatory properties that target joint inflammation. The tea reduces inflammation throughout the body, which can help manage a variety of inflammatory conditions. Additionally, it fights anxiety attacks by supporting mental well-being and reducing stress hormones.</p>
<p>Overall, Boswellia serrata tea offers a natural approach to improving multiple aspects of health.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata tea contains boswellic acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Among these, acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid is particularly effective in inhibiting inflammatory enzymes like 5-lipoxygenase. The tea also includes ferulic acid and caffeic acid, both of which act as powerful antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals. Quercetin, another key constituent, contributes to the tea's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Together, these bioactive compounds make Boswellia serrata tea a valuable natural remedy for various health conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Boswella serrata tea is traditionally made using the resinous sap extracted from the tree's bark, which contains active compounds like boswellic acids.</p>
<p>The most commonly used part of the plant is the gum resin, harvested from the trunk and branches, as it is rich in therapeutic properties. Leaves are occasionally used in some preparations, though they are less common than the resin. Roots are rarely utilized in tea-making due to their lower concentration of active ingredients.</p>
<p>Overall, the resin from the bark remains the primary component in Boswellia serrata medicinal tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Boswellia serrata tea can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to digestive discomfort or bloating due to its resinous compounds. In rare cases, it might interact with medications, particularly those affecting blood clotting or the immune system. Long-term use could potentially result in liver enzyme elevation, though this is uncommon.</p>
<p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before regular consumption, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
