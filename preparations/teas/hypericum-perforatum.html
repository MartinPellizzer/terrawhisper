<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea has been used to treat mild depression and improve mood for centuries, with historical roots in ancient Greek and Roman medicine.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it was valued in European herbalism for its purported ability to alleviate symptoms of melancholy and nervous exhaustion. In modern times, it is commonly used as a complementary therapy for mild depressive symptoms, often under the name St. John's Wort. Scientific studies suggest it may have antidepressant effects, though it can interact with other medications.</p>
<p>Despite its long history, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use due to potential side effects and interactions.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>It contains compounds like hyperforin and flavonoids that may support mental well-being by increasing neurotransmitter levels in the brain. This tea is also known to help with mild anxiety and may enhance sleep quality. Additionally, it has antioxidant properties that can support overall immune function and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>It is often used as a natural alternative to support emotional health and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea active constituents include hypericin, hyperforin, flavonoids, tannins, and essential oils.</p>
<p>These compounds are believed to contribute to the tea's potential mood-enhancing and antidepressant effects.

The tea is often used to support mental well-being and alleviate symptoms of mild depression.</p>
<p>Additionally, the flavonoids and tannins may provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Hypericum perforatum tea, start by gathering dried Hypericum perforatum (St. Johnâ€™s Wort) herbs.</p>
<p>Measure about 1 teaspoon of the dried herb and place it in a heatproof container or teapot. Pour freshly boiled water over the herbs and let it steep for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the liquid to remove the plant material.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It can also cause photosensitivity, making the skin more sensitive to sunlight and increasing the risk of sunburn. In higher doses, it may interact with certain medications, such as antidepressants, anticoagulants, and blood sugar regulators, potentially leading to serious health complications. Prolonged use might result in liver damage, although this is rare.</p>
