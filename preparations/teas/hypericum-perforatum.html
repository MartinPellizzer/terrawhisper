<p>Hypericum perforatum tea is a herbal preparation made from the dried flowers and leaves of the St. John's wort plant.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbalism to support mood and alleviate symptoms of mild depression. The tea is often consumed as a calming remedy to reduce anxiety and promote emotional well-being. It is also used externally to treat skin conditions and wounds due to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution as it may interact with certain medications.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea relieves depression symptoms by increasing serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, which are neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation.</p>
<p>It also reduces inflammation markers through its active compounds, such as hyperforin and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. The tea helps reduce oxidative stress by acting as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Additionally, it can lower anxiety levels by modulating the nervous system and promoting a sense of calm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hypericum perforatum tea may increase melatonin production, aiding in better sleep quality and overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea contains hyperforin, a key bioactive compound known for its antidepressant and mood-enhancing properties.</p>
<p>Alongside hyperforin, the tea also includes quercetin, a flavonoid with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Adhyperforin, a derivative of hyperforin, contributes to the tea's neuroprotective and antimicrobial benefits. Kaempferol, another flavonoid present, supports cardiovascular health and exhibits anti-cancer potential.</p>
<p>Lastly, hyperoside, a glycoside, aids in reducing inflammation and enhancing the immune system.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea is primarily made from the leaves and flowers of the plant, which are the most commonly used parts for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain hypericin and hyperforin, compounds known for their antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects. The flowers are also harvested and used to contribute to the tea's distinctive yellow color and mild flavor. While the roots are occasionally used, they are less common in traditional preparations compared to the leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves and flowers are the most essential components in making Hypericum perforatum tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Hypericum perforatum tea can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, stomach upset, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to increased sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in a higher risk of sunburn. In rare cases, it can cause dizziness or headaches, especially when consumed in large amounts. Long-term use might interfere with certain medications, particularly antidepressants, due to its potential to affect liver enzymes.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using this tea, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p>
