<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis tea reduces inflammation now by containing powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that help calm the body's immune response.</p>
<p>It fights cancer cells through its high concentration of polyphenols, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of malignant cells. This tea eases pain quickly due to its natural analgesic properties, making it beneficial for conditions like arthritis or muscle soreness. It boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells, enhancing the body's ability to fight off infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, its antimicrobial properties help fight off infections by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and viruses.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis tea contains rosmarinic acid, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound known for its ability to neutralize free radicals and support immune function.</p>
<p>Alongside rosmarinic acid, carvacrol is present, which exhibits antimicrobial properties and may aid in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Linalool contributes to the tea's calming effects and has been shown to have sedative and anti-anxiety properties. Caryophyllene, another key constituent, acts as a natural anti-inflammatory and may also have potential in reducing pain and improving mood.</p>
<p>Lastly, cineole, a monoterpene, supports respiratory health and may help alleviate symptoms of respiratory conditions such as coughing and congestion.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis tea is primarily made using the leaves of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain essential oils, such as camphor and rosmarinic acid, that contribute to the tea's therapeutic effects. While the stems and flowers may also be used in some preparations, they are less common compared to the leaves. The roots of the plant are rarely used in tea-making due to their minimal contribution to flavor and medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves are the key component in most Rosmarinus officinalis tea formulations.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Rosmarinus officinalis tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, heartburn, or stomach cramps, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, including skin rashes or respiratory symptoms. The tea has a diuretic effect, which can increase urination and potentially lead to dehydration if not balanced with adequate fluid intake. Some people may experience insomnia or restlessness due to its mild stimulating properties.</p>
<p>Long-term or excessive consumption might result in liver or kidney stress, though this is rare in typical usage.</p>
