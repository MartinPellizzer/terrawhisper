<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

Reduce the heat and let it simmer for approximately 15 to 20 minutes to allow the flavors and beneficial properties to infuse into the water.</p>
<p>Strain the tea into a cup and enjoy it warm, optionally adding a touch of honey or lemon for enhanced taste.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Angelica archangelica tea may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to plants in the carrot family, such as celery and parsley. Prolonged use may increase the risk of bleeding due to its potential blood-thinning properties. High doses may lead to liver toxicity, though this is rare.</p>
