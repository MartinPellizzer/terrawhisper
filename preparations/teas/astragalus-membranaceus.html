<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tea reduces inflammation by containing bioactive compounds that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
<p>It supports liver function by promoting detoxification processes and protecting liver cells from damage. The tea also supports the respiratory system by enhancing lung capacity and reducing mucus production. Additionally, it boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it fights infections due to its antimicrobial and antiviral properties, making it a valuable herbal remedy for overall health.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tea contains phenylethanoid glycosides, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides in the tea contribute to immune system support and enhance the body's resistance to stress. Saponins present in the tea have antimicrobial and cholesterol-lowering effects. Astragalosides, a group of glycosides, are believed to support cardiovascular health and improve cellular function.</p>
<p>Monosaccharides contribute to the tea's sweet taste and may play a role in energy metabolism.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus tea is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds such as polysaccharides and flavonoids.</p>
<p>The roots are typically harvested during the autumn season when their medicinal properties are most potent. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used in lesser quantities, they contribute less to the overall potency of the tea. The root is the most valued part for its immune-boosting and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its high concentration of bioactive compounds, the root remains the primary component in most traditional formulations of Astragalus membranaceus tea.</p>
