<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera tea eradicates free radicals by acting as a powerful antioxidant, helping to neutralize harmful molecules that can damage cells.</p>
<p>It improves heart health by reducing oxidative stress and lowering cholesterol levels, which supports overall cardiovascular function. The tea protects liver function by promoting detoxification processes and reducing the risk of liver damage from toxins. It reduces inflammation through its anti-inflammatory compounds, which can alleviate symptoms of chronic inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Vitis vinifera tea increases antioxidant levels in the body, enhancing the immune system and contributing to long-term health benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera tea contains epicatechin, a powerful antioxidant that helps reduce oxidative stress and supports cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Resveratrol, another key constituent, is known for its anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties. Anthocyanins contribute to the tea's deep color and offer additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. Quercetin, a flavonoid, further enhances the tea's ability to combat free radicals and support immune function.</p>
<p>Sugars present in the tea provide a natural sweetness while also influencing the tea's overall nutritional profile.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera tea is primarily made from the leaves, stems, and roots of the grapevine plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are commonly used for their high antioxidant content and are often dried and steeped to create a herbal infusion. The stems, which contain a significant amount of resveratrol, are also harvested and processed for their medicinal properties. Roots are less frequently used but can be included in certain traditional formulations for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>These parts are valued for their potential to support cardiovascular health, reduce inflammation, and provide other therapeutic effects.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vitis vinifera tea can cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, or diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to headaches or dizziness due to its mild sedative properties. Some people may experience allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially if they are sensitive to grapes or related plants. Long-term use might result in liver or kidney issues, though this is rare.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before consuming this tea, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
