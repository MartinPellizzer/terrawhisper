<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum tea reduces blood pressure by promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system due to its high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. This tea improves heart health by reducing bad cholesterol levels and preventing plaque buildup in arteries. It can treat diabetes symptoms by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, it relieves menstrual cramps through its analgesic and antispasmodic properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum tea contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a key compound responsible for its aromatic flavor and potential antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Eugenol, another bioactive constituent, contributes to the tea's spicy scent and may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Gallic acid is present in the tea and is known for its antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Cinnamyl alcohol adds to the tea's complex flavor profile and may also exhibit some antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Lignans, found in the tea, are phytoestrogens that may support cardiovascular health and have antioxidant effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Cinnamomum verum tea is primarily made from the inner bark of the cinnamon tree, which contains the essential oils and aromatic compounds that give it its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The bark is the most commonly used part, as it is rich in cinnamaldehyde and other bioactive compounds. While leaves and twigs may be used in some preparations, they are less prevalent compared to the bark. The roots of the plant are rarely used in tea-making due to their limited contribution to the flavor and medicinal profile.</p>
<p>Overall, the bark remains the most important and widely utilized part of the Cinnamomum verum plant in the preparation of medicinal tea.</p>
