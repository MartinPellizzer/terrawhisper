<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Gymnema sylvestre tea fights against diabetes by helping to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce glucose absorption in the intestines.</p>
<p>It also reduces insulin resistance, making it easier for the body to utilize insulin effectively. This herbal tea lowers cholesterol levels by improving lipid profiles and reducing bad cholesterol (LDL). Additionally, it reduces inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory markers in the body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gymnema sylvestre tea supports liver health by promoting detoxification and protecting liver cells from damage.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Gymnema sylvestre tea contains phytosterols, which are plant-derived compounds that may help lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestines.</p>
<p>It also contains gymnemic acid, a group of compounds known for their ability to reduce glucose absorption and support blood sugar regulation. Gurmarin, another key constituent, acts as a bitter compound that may suppress sweet taste perception and reduce sugar cravings. The tea is rich in fatty acids, which contribute to its overall nutritional profile and may support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contains dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and promotes a feeling of fullness, supporting weight management efforts.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Gymnema sylvestre tea is primarily made from the leaves of the plant, which contain the active compound gymnemic acid.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part due to their high concentration of beneficial compounds. They are typically harvested when fully mature to ensure maximum potency. The roots are sometimes used as well, but they are less common in tea preparation.</p>
<p>The stems may also be included in some formulations, though they are not as widely utilized as the leaves.</p>
