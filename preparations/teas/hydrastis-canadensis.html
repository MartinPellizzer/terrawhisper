<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Hydrastis canadensis tea has been used to treat digestive issues, skin conditions, and respiratory ailments for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, Indigenous peoples of North America utilized the plant, known as goldenseal, for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In traditional medicine, it was often prepared as a tea to support liver function and aid in detoxification. Modern uses include its application in herbal remedies for oral health and as a natural supplement to support immune function.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential for overuse and interactions with medications, it is advised to consult a healthcare professional before regular consumption.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>However, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it can interact with certain medications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Hydrastis canadensis tea active constituents include berberine, hydrastine, canadine, and other alkaloids.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>

<p>This herbal preparation is known for its bitter taste and is traditionally used for digestive support and as a natural remedy for various ailments.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
