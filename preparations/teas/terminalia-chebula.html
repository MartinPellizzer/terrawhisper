<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tea fights cancer cells by containing compounds that inhibit the growth of malignant cells and induce apoptosis.</p>
<p>It reduces oxidative stress through its high antioxidant content, which neutralizes free radicals and protects cells from damage. This tea also reduces fever quickly by supporting the body's natural cooling mechanisms and reducing inflammation. Additionally, it supports the anti-aging process by promoting cellular repair and enhancing skin health.</p>
<p>Lastly, Terminalia chebula tea enhances the immune system, helping the body defend against infections and diseases more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tea contains triterpenoids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It also includes ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound with potential anticancer and detoxifying effects. Gallic acid is another key constituent, recognized for its antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The tea is rich in ellagitannins, which are complex polyphenols that may support digestive health and have anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, flavonoids present in the tea contribute to its overall antioxidant capacity and may help in reducing oxidative stress in the body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Terminalia chebula tea is primarily made from the dried fruit of the Terminalia chebula plant, which is known as the chebulic myrobalan.</p>
<p>The fruit is the most commonly used part for medicinal purposes due to its high concentration of tannins and other bioactive compounds. While the leaves and bark are also used in some traditional preparations, they are less common than the fruit. The roots of the plant are occasionally used, but they are not as prevalent in tea formulations.</p>
<p>Overall, the fruit remains the key component in most Terminalia chebula tea preparations.</p>
