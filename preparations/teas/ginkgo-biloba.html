<p>Ginkgo biloba tea is a traditional herbal preparation made from the leaves of the ginkgo tree, known for its distinct fan-shaped leaves and ancient lineage.</p>
<p>This tea is commonly used in herbalism to enhance cognitive function, improve memory, and support circulation due to its rich content of flavonoids and terpene lactones. It is often consumed to promote mental clarity and may help with symptoms of dementia or age-related cognitive decline. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is also valued for its antioxidant properties and its ability to support respiratory and circulatory health.</p>
<p>The preparation is typically brewed by steeping dried leaves in hot water, and it is consumed as a calming, invigorating beverage.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tea reduce inflammation by containing potent anti-inflammatory compounds that help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>It also improves memory by enhancing cognitive function and increasing blood flow to the brain, which supports neural health. This tea regulates blood pressure through its vasodilatory effects, promoting cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of hypertension. Additionally, it improves circulation by stimulating the production of nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels and enhances blood flow throughout the body.</p>
<p>Lastly, Ginkgo biloba tea improves antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals, which protects cells from oxidative damage and supports overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tea contains phytosterols, which are plant-derived compounds that may support cardiovascular health by helping to lower cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, it includes ginkgolides, a group of unique terpene lactones known for their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Flavonoids are also present, contributing to the tea's antioxidant effects and potentially improving cognitive function. Bilobalide, another important compound, is believed to enhance memory and may have neuroprotective benefits.</p>
<p>Lastly, biflavonoids, which are less commonly found in other plants, further contribute to the tea's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tea is primarily made from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, which are the most commonly used part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The leaves contain high levels of flavonoids and terpene lactones, which are believed to contribute to the tea's cognitive and circulatory benefits. While the roots are occasionally used in traditional medicine, they are less common in modern tea preparations due to their stronger taste and potential for toxicity. The seeds, or "ginkgo nuts," are sometimes used but are generally avoided because of their bitter taste and possible harmful effects.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves remain the most popular and safest part of the Ginkgo biloba plant for making medicinal tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ginkgo biloba tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to headaches or dizziness, especially when consumed in large quantities. Allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, are possible in people sensitive to the plant. In rare cases, it may interact with medications, particularly blood thinners, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting regular consumption, especially for those with existing health conditions.</p>
