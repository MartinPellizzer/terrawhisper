<p>Sambucus nigra tea is a herbal preparation made from the dried berries of the European elder tree.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in herbalism for its purported immune-boosting properties and as a remedy for colds and flu. The tea is often prepared by steeping the berries in hot water, and it may also be combined with other herbs for enhanced effects. In traditional medicine, it has been used to support respiratory health and as a mild diuretic.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution, as raw berries can be toxic.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tea fights viral infections due to its high concentration of antioxidants and antiviral compounds that help reduce the severity and duration of viral illnesses.</p>
<p>It relieves coughs by soothing the throat and reducing inflammation in the respiratory tract. The tea also relieves sore throats by providing a cooling effect and reducing irritation. Additionally, it treats cold sores by inhibiting the herpes simplex virus, which causes them.</p>
<p>Sambucus nigra tea fights bacterial infections thanks to its antimicrobial properties that support the body's natural defenses.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tea contains isosalipurpurin, which exhibits antiviral and antifungal properties, making it beneficial for immune support.</p>
<p>It also contains flavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and protect cells from oxidative stress. Phenolic acids contribute to the tea's antioxidant capacity and may support cardiovascular health. Lignans are known for their potential to reduce cholesterol levels and improve gut health.</p>
<p>Terpenoids in the tea provide additional anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits, enhancing its overall therapeutic profile.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra tea is primarily made from the flowers, berries, and leaves of the plant.</p>
<p>The flowers are the most commonly used part, as they provide a delicate, sweet flavor and are rich in antioxidants. The berries, while sometimes used, are often dried and processed into syrups or tinctures rather than direct tea. Leaves are also used in some traditional preparations, though they are less common than flowers.</p>
<p>Roots are rarely used in tea-making due to their strong, bitter taste and limited medicinal properties compared to other parts.</p>
