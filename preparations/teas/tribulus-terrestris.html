<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris tea has been used to enhance vitality and support reproductive health for centuries, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its purported ability to boost libido and improve physical performance, often used by athletes and warriors. In modern contexts, it is commonly consumed as a dietary supplement to support testosterone levels and overall energy. Some studies suggest potential benefits for cardiovascular health and stress reduction, though results remain inconclusive.</p>
<p>Despite its long history of use, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into one's routine.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris tea has health benefits such as enhancing energy levels, supporting sexual health, and promoting muscle growth.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used to improve libido and fertility in both men and women. This herbal preparation may also help in reducing stress and improving overall vitality. Some studies suggest it could have antioxidant properties that protect cells from damage.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, as it may interact with certain medications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris tea active constituents include alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, and amino acids.</p>
<p>These compounds are believed to support hormonal balance and enhance physical performance. Saponins, in particular, are thought to stimulate the production of testosterone and other sex hormones. Flavonoids contribute to the tea's antioxidant properties, which may help reduce inflammation and support cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Amino acids in the tea can aid in muscle recovery and overall energy levels.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Tribulus terrestris tea, start by gathering 1 to 2 tablespoons of dried Tribulus terrestris leaves or seeds.</p>
<p>Place the herb in a heatproof container and pour about 8 ounces of boiling water over it. Let the mixture steep for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the active compounds to infuse into the water. Strain the tea through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.</p>
<p>Drink the tea warm, either on its own or with a bit of honey or lemon for added flavor.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Tribulus terrestris tea may lead to increased heart rate, digestive issues, and hormonal imbalances.</p>
<p>It is often used for its purported benefits in enhancing libido and athletic performance. However, it can also cause insomnia, anxiety, and skin reactions in some individuals. Long-term use might interfere with hormone levels, particularly in those with pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this herbal preparation, especially if you are on medication or have underlying health issues.</p>
