<p>Equisetum arvense tea is a herbal preparation made from the dried stems of the field horsetail plant.</p>
<p>It is traditionally used in herbalism for its high silica content, which is believed to support joint health and bone strength. The tea is often consumed to promote urinary tract health and as a diuretic. It may also be used to aid in the treatment of respiratory conditions and to support the detoxification process.</p>
<p>However, it should be used with caution due to its potential to cause kidney issues if not prepared or consumed properly.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense tea reduces inflammation by containing compounds that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
<p>It fights off bacteria due to its natural antimicrobial properties, making it beneficial for preventing infections. This tea boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of white blood cells and enhancing overall body defenses. It eases joint pain by reducing swelling and stiffness associated with conditions like arthritis.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can help ease skin irritations by soothing inflammation and promoting healing of minor skin issues.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense tea contains furanofurane glycosides, which are known for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Fucosterol, another key constituent, exhibits antioxidant and anti-cancer activities, contributing to the tea's therapeutic value. Saponins in the tea may support immune function and have cholesterol-lowering effects. Squalene, a natural compound, is associated with skin health and may have protective effects against oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Stachydrine, a unique alkaloid, is believed to possess antimicrobial and antitussive properties, further enhancing the tea's medicinal profile.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Equisetum arvense tea is traditionally made using the plant's stems, which are the most commonly utilized part for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The stems contain high concentrations of silica and other bioactive compounds that contribute to the tea's therapeutic properties. While the leaves are sometimes used, they are less common compared to the stems. The roots of Equisetum arvense are rarely used in tea preparation due to their limited availability and lower potency.</p>
<p>Overall, the stems remain the primary component in the preparation of this herbal tea.</p>
