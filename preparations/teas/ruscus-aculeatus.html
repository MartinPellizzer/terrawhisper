This tea may help alleviate symptoms of varicose veins and venous insufficiency by promoting better blood flow. It is often prepared by steeping the dried leaves in hot water and consumed as a daily tonic.</p>
<p>In some cultures, it is also used to support cardiovascular health and reduce swelling.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ruscus aculeatus tea soothes skin irritation by reducing inflammation and promoting healing of minor skin conditions.</p>
<p>It relaxes muscle tension through its mild vasodilatory effects, which help alleviate stress-related muscle soreness. This tea supports the body's natural detoxification processes by aiding in the removal of toxins from the bloodstream. Its calming properties can improve sleep quality by reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may help treat arthritis pain by reducing joint inflammation and improving circulation to affected areas.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ruscus aculeatus tea contains cardiac glycosides, which have been historically used for their potential cardiovascular benefits, though their exact mechanisms in tea consumption remain under investigation.</p>
<p>The tea is also rich in polyphenols, which act as potent antioxidants, helping to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress in the body. Saponins present in the tea contribute to its bitter taste and may support immune function and cholesterol regulation. Flavonoids, another key component, are known for their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, phenolic acids in the tea contribute to its overall antioxidant profile, supporting overall health and potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ruscus aculeatus tea is traditionally made using the leaves and roots of the plant, which are the most commonly utilized parts for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically harvested during the spring and early summer when their potency is highest. The roots, which are often dried and ground into a powder, are known for their ability to support circulation and reduce inflammation. Both the leaves and roots contain compounds that contribute to the tea's therapeutic properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects.</p>
<p>These parts are carefully prepared to ensure the tea retains its medicinal benefits without harmful side effects.</p>
