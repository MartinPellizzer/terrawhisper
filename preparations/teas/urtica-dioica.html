<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Urtica dioica tea relieve itching by soothing the skin and reducing histamine levels, making it effective for conditions like hives or eczema.</p>
<p>It also promotes rapid wound healing due to its high content of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. This tea supports the immune system by providing essential nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and K, which enhance the body's defense mechanisms. Additionally, it can heal burns quickly because of its soothing and regenerative properties.</p>
<p>Lastly, Urtica dioica tea is beneficial for treating allergies by reducing inflammation and improving respiratory function.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Urtica dioica tea contains furanocoumarins, which are known for their phototoxic properties and potential anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Flavonoids in the tea contribute to its antioxidant capacity, helping to neutralize free radicals in the body. Inulin, a prebiotic fiber, supports gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria. Tannins present in the tea have astringent properties and may aid in digestion and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides contribute to the tea's immune-boosting properties and may help regulate blood sugar levels.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Urtica dioica tea is traditionally made using the leaves and stems of the stinging nettle plant, which are the most commonly utilized parts for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested when young and tender, as they contain higher concentrations of nutrients like vitamins A, C, and K, as well as minerals such as iron and calcium. The stems, while less commonly used, are also employed for their mild diuretic properties and can be combined with the leaves to enhance the tea's benefits. Both parts are often dried and steeped in hot water to create a soothing and nourishing beverage.</p>
<p>These components are valued for their anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, and immune-boosting properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
