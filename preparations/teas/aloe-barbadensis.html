<h2 id="0">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Aloe barbadensis tea is primarily made from the gel extracted from the leaves of the Aloe barbadensis plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are the most commonly used part, as they contain the thick, gel-like substance rich in nutrients and active compounds. While the roots are rarely used in tea preparation, they can be included in some traditional formulations. The outer layer of the leaves, known as the skin, is often removed before extracting the gel.</p>
<p>The inner pulp and latex found within the leaves are also sometimes used, though they are less common in medicinal teas due to their potential irritant properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Aloe barbadensis tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, especially when consumed in large quantities.</p>
<p>It may also lead to nausea or stomach cramps in some individuals due to its laxative properties. Long-term use can result in electrolyte imbalances, as the tea can increase bowel movements excessively. In rare cases, it may cause allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating this tea into your routine, particularly if you have existing digestive issues or are on medication.</p>
