While the leaves are sometimes used in smaller quantities, they are less common than the flowers in commercial tea preparations. The roots of Lavandula angustifolia are rarely used in medicinal tea, as they contain fewer active compounds compared to the flowers.</p>
<p>Overall, the flowers remain the most valued and utilized part of the plant for making lavender tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
