<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Passiflora incarnata tea reduces stress by promoting relaxation and calming the nervous system through its natural sedative properties.</p>
<p>It eases anxiety by increasing the production of neurotransmitters like GABA, which help regulate mood and reduce feelings of worry. The tea also soothes insomnia by helping to induce a state of calm and improve sleep quality. It may treat depression by supporting emotional well-being and reducing symptoms of low mood.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can reduce pain by acting as a mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Passiflora incarnata tea contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Alkaloids present in the tea contribute to its calming effects and may influence the central nervous system. Phytoecdysteroids are unique compounds that may support muscle development and cellular function. Triterpenoids in the tea exhibit potential anti-cancer and hepatoprotective activities.</p>
<p>Fatty acids contribute to the tea's overall nutritional profile and may support cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Passiflora incarnata tea is primarily made using the leaves, flowers, and roots of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are commonly harvested and dried to create the base of the tea due to their mild flavor and medicinal properties. The flowers are also used, as they contribute a subtle floral aroma and contain compounds that enhance the teaâ€™s calming effects. Roots are less frequently used but can be included for their additional therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Together, these parts are valued for their ability to promote relaxation and support sleep.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Passiflora incarnata tea can cause drowsiness and sedation due to its mild sedative properties.</p>
<p>It may also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea or stomach upset in some individuals. Headaches are another common side effect, particularly if the tea is consumed in large quantities. In rare cases, it may cause allergic reactions, including rash or itching.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those on medication or with existing health conditions.</p>
