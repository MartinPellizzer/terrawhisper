<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Matricaria chamomilla tea relieves digestive issues by soothing the gastrointestinal tract and reducing inflammation.</p>
<p>It treats insomnia problems due to its calming properties that promote relaxation and ease anxiety. This tea improves sleep quality by enhancing the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and reducing nighttime disturbances. Additionally, it reduces stress levels through its mild sedative effects and ability to lower cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, Matricaria chamomilla tea reduces nausea levels, making it a beneficial remedy for morning sickness and motion sickness.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Matricaria chamomilla tea contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Among these, apigenin stands out as a key flavone that contributes to the tea's calming effects. Bisabolol, a monoterpene, is another important constituent that exhibits anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. Terpinen-4-ol, a major component of chamomile essential oil, is renowned for its antimicrobial and antifungal activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, flavonol glycosides enhance the tea's overall bioavailability and support its therapeutic potential in various health applications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>

The roots of Matricaria chamomilla are rarely used in tea preparations due to their minimal contribution to the therapeutic effects.</p>
