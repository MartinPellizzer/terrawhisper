<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Ocimum basilicum tea eases digestion issues by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and reducing bloating.</p>
<p>It fights bacterial infections due to its high concentration of antibacterial compounds like eugenol. The tea soothes skin irritations by reducing inflammation and promoting healing of minor wounds. It treats diarrhea issues by regulating intestinal motility and reducing gut inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces inflammation quickly, making it beneficial for conditions like arthritis and respiratory disorders.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Ocimum basilicum tea contains ursolic acid, a triterpenoid compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Linalool, a monoterpene, contributes to the tea's aromatic profile and also exhibits calming and antispasmodic effects. Quercetin, a flavonoid, is a potent antioxidant that supports immune function and may help reduce oxidative stress. Rosmarinic acid, another phenolic compound, is recognized for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective benefits.</p>
<p>Oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, has been studied for its potential in supporting liver health and reducing cholesterol levels.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Ocimum basilicum tea is primarily made using the leaves of the basil plant, which are the most commonly utilized part for their aromatic and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are harvested when they are fully grown and aromatic, ensuring maximum flavor and medicinal benefits. While the roots of Ocimum basilicum are occasionally used in traditional medicine, they are less common compared to the leaves. The flowers may also be used in some preparations, but the leaves remain the primary component.</p>
<p>Overall, the leaves are the most essential part of the plant for making medicinal tea due to their high concentration of essential oils and active compounds.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Ocimum basilicum tea can cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea or upset stomach, especially when consumed in large amounts.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to basil, including skin rashes or itching. Some people may experience headaches or dizziness due to the essential oils present in the herb. Additionally, it can interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting the liver or blood pressure.</p>
<p>Overall, while generally safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before regular use.</p>
