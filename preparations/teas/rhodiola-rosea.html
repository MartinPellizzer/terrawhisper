<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tea reduces stress levels by regulating the body's stress response and lowering cortisol levels.</p>
<p>It boosts mood naturally through its adaptogenic properties that enhance serotonin and dopamine production. This tea enhances cognitive function by improving memory, attention, and mental clarity. It increases mental focus by supporting brain health and reducing mental fatigue.</p>
<p>Additionally, it reduces anxiety symptoms by promoting emotional balance and calming the nervous system.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tea contains rosavin, which is a key alkaloid known for its adaptogenic properties and ability to enhance physical endurance.</p>
<p>Salidroside, another major constituent, contributes to the tea's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Triterpene saponins in the tea support immune function and may help reduce stress. Rosarin, a rare compound, is believed to enhance cognitive performance and mood regulation.</p>
<p>Caffeic acid, a polyphenol, provides additional antioxidant benefits and may aid in reducing oxidative stress in the body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tea is primarily made from the roots of the plant, which contain the highest concentration of active compounds like rosavins and salidrosides.</p>
<p>The roots are typically dried and ground into a powder before being used to brew the tea. While the leaves may also be used in some preparations, they are less common compared to the roots. The root's potency makes it the most valued part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>This makes the root the most commonly used component in Rhodiola rosea tea formulations.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Rhodiola rosea tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, and stomach cramps in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to sleep disturbances, including insomnia, due to its stimulating properties. Headaches and increased heart rate are additional side effects that have been reported by users. In rare cases, it may cause allergic reactions like rash or itching.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p>
