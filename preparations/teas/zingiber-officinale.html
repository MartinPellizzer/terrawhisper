<p>In many cultures, it is used as a natural remedy for colds, sore throats, and muscle pain.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Zingiber officinale tea relieve nausea symptoms by stimulating the digestive system and reducing stomach discomfort.</p>
<p>It also helps ease digestive issues such as bloating and indigestion due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The tea can reduce menstrual cramps by promoting blood circulation and alleviating uterine tension. Additionally, it may relieve joint pain by reducing inflammation and supporting overall joint health.</p>
<p>Lastly, Zingiber officinale tea can reduce stress levels by acting as a natural calming agent and improving mood.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Zingiber officinale tea contains gingerols, which are potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds known for their ability to alleviate nausea and muscle pain.</p>
<p>Zingiberene contributes to the tea's distinctive aroma and may possess antimicrobial properties. Shogaols, formed when ginger is dried, are more thermally stable than gingerols and also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Bisabolol, though less common in ginger, has soothing and anti-inflammatory properties that may enhance the tea's therapeutic benefits.</p>
<p>Catechins, present in smaller amounts, provide additional antioxidant support and may aid in metabolic health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Zingiber officinale tea is primarily made from the rhizome, which is the underground stem of the plant and contains the majority of the active compounds.</p>
<p>The rhizome is the most commonly used part for medicinal purposes due to its high concentration of gingerol and other bioactive compounds. While the leaves of the plant are sometimes used, they are less common in tea preparations compared to the rhizome. The flowers and young shoots may also be used in some traditional formulations, but they are not as prevalent as the rhizome.</p>
<p>Overall, the rhizome remains the most essential and widely utilized part of the Zingiber officinale plant in the production of medicinal tea.</p>
