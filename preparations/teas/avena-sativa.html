<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Avena sativa tea reduces stress levels by promoting the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA, which help regulate emotional responses.</p>
<p>It improves mood stability by supporting the production of endorphins and reducing cortisol levels in the body. This tea eases anxiety symptoms through its calming effects on the nervous system and its rich content of minerals such as magnesium and zinc. Additionally, it enhances cognitive function by improving blood flow to the brain and supporting neural health.</p>
<p>Lastly, Avena sativa tea reduces inflammation and pain due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Avena sativa tea contains polyphenols, which are known for their antioxidant properties and ability to reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>It also includes avenanthramides, unique compounds that contribute to its calming effects and may support cardiovascular health. The tea contains starch, which provides a source of energy and helps in maintaining digestive health. Lignans present in the tea act as phytoestrogens and may support hormonal balance.</p>
<p>Additionally, flavonoids contribute to the tea's antioxidant profile and may enhance overall immune function.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Avena sativa tea is primarily made from the oat kernel, which is the mature seed of the plant.</p>
<p>The most commonly used part is the whole grain, including the bran, germ, and endosperm, as these components contribute to the tea's nutritional profile and flavor. While the leaves are occasionally used in some traditional preparations, they are not as prevalent as the grains. The roots and stems are rarely used in medicinal tea formulations due to their minimal contribution to the overall benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, the oat kernel remains the primary and most utilized part of the Avena sativa plant for making medicinal tea.</p>
