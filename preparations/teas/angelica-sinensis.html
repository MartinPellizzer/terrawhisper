<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tea reduces inflammation by containing compounds that inhibit inflammatory responses in the body.</p>
<p>It boosts the immune system by enhancing the production of white blood cells and antioxidants. This tea can relieve headaches and ease pain due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. It also reduces stress by promoting relaxation and balancing hormone levels.</p>
<p>Overall, Angelica sinensis tea offers a range of health benefits that support both physical and mental well-being.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tea contains ligustilide, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Butylphthalide contributes to the tea's ability to improve circulation and reduce oxidative stress. Quercetin, a potent antioxidant, supports immune function and may help in preventing chronic diseases. Ursolic acid is recognized for its potential to enhance muscle mass and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Beta-sitosterol aids in lowering cholesterol levels and may support prostate health.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tea is primarily made from the dried roots of the plant, which are the most commonly used part for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The roots contain high levels of compounds like ferulic acid and ligustilide, contributing to its therapeutic effects. While the leaves and stems are sometimes used, they are less common compared to the roots. The root is typically harvested in the fall and processed to enhance its potency.</p>
<p>This part of the plant is valued for its ability to support blood health and alleviate menstrual discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Angelica sinensis tea can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, bloating, and diarrhea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, including skin rashes or itching, especially in those with known sensitivities to its components. Long-term use might result in hormonal imbalances due to its phytoestrogen content, potentially affecting menstrual cycles. In rare cases, it can contribute to liver toxicity, particularly when consumed in high doses or over extended periods.</p>
<p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before regular use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
