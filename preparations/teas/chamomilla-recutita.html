<p>Chamomilla recutita tea is a herbal preparation made from the dried flowers of the chamomile plant.</p>
<p>It is widely used in herbalism for its calming and soothing properties. This tea is often consumed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and digestive discomfort. It can also be applied topically to reduce inflammation and promote skin healing.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, Chamomilla recutita tea is valued for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="0">Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita tea reduces inflammation by containing compounds like bisabolol and flavonoids that inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body.</p>
<p>It calms anxiety through its mild sedative effects, thanks to the presence of apigenin, which binds to GABA receptors in the brain. This tea eases digestion by relaxing the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and reducing spasms. It also relaxes muscles, making it beneficial for those suffering from muscle tension or pain.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chamomilla recutita tea treats allergies by modulating the immune response and reducing histamine release.</p>

<h2 id="1">Bioactive Constituents</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita tea contains flavonoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Among these, apigenin stands out as a key flavone that contributes to the tea's calming effects and may support cardiovascular health. The tea also contains sesquiterpenes, particularly bisabolol, which is responsible for its soothing and anti-inflammatory actions. Furanocoumarins, though present in smaller amounts, can interact with sunlight and may cause phototoxicity, so their presence should be noted.</p>
<p>Luteolin, another flavonoid, enhances the tea's antioxidant capacity and may help in reducing oxidative stress in the body.</p>

<h2 id="2">Plant Parts</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita tea is primarily made from the dried flowers of the plant, which contain the essential compounds responsible for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The flowers are the most commonly used part, as they provide the active ingredients like flavonoids and terpenoids. While other parts of the plant, such as the leaves and stems, may be used in some traditional preparations, they are less common and typically not the main component. The roots of Chamomilla recutita are rarely used in tea-making due to their minimal contribution to the therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Overall, the flowers remain the most valued and widely utilized part of the plant for medicinal tea.</p>

<h2 id="3">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Chamomilla recutita tea can cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort such as stomach upset or nausea in some individuals.</p>
<p>It may also lead to allergic reactions, particularly in people with pollen allergies due to its similar proteins. Drowsiness or dizziness is another common side effect, as the tea contains sedative properties. In rare cases, excessive consumption can result in headaches or fatigue.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p>
