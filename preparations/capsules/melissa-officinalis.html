<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis capsule has been used to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety for centuries, with roots in ancient Greek and Roman herbal traditions.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its calming properties and was often used to ease nervous tension and improve mood. In traditional medicine, it was also employed to support digestion and treat respiratory conditions. Modern research has confirmed its potential in reducing stress and enhancing cognitive function, making it a popular supplement today.</p>
<p>Its continued use highlights its enduring value in both traditional and contemporary health practices.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>Melissa officinalis capsules are generally safe when taken in recommended doses, making them a popular choice for natural health support.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis capsule active constituents include essential oils, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and rosmarinic acid.</p>
<p>These compounds contribute to the herb's calming and anti-inflammatory properties.

<p>Overall, these active constituents make Melissa officinalis capsules beneficial for stress relief, digestive health, and overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Melissa officinalis capsule, start by harvesting fresh or dried lemon balm leaves.</p>
<p>Clean the leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped leaves in a jar and cover them with a high-quality oil, such as olive oil or a carrier oil of your choice. Let the mixture steep for at least four weeks in a cool, dark place, shaking the jar occasionally.</p>
<p>After the steeping period, strain the oil through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and then pour the infused oil into clean, sterilized capsules for use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Melissa officinalis capsule may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, particularly at higher doses.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as rash, itching, or swelling. Long-term use might interfere with certain medications, such as anticoagulants, due to its potential blood-thinning effects. Some users may experience insomnia or restlessness due to its mild stimulant properties.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p>
