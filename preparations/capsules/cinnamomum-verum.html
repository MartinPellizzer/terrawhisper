<p>Wash the bark thoroughly and slice it into thin, even strips to ensure even extraction. Next, place the slices in a pot and add water, bringing it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes to extract the essence. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any solids, then allow it to cool and store it in a sealed container in the refrigerator.</p>
