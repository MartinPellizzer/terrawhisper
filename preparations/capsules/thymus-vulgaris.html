<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Thymus vulgaris capsule, first gather fresh or dried thyme leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Wash the thyme thoroughly and chop it into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the chopped thyme in a clean jar and cover it with a high-quality oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil. Let the mixture sit in a dark place for 4 to 6 weeks, shaking the jar occasionally to ensure even infusion.</p>
<p>After the infusion period, strain the oil through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove the plant material, and store the infused oil in a cool, dark place in a sealed container.</p>
