<p>Wash and dry the cranberries thoroughly, then grind them into a fine powder using a blender or food processor.

<p>This preparation can be used as a natural remedy for urinary tract health and digestive support.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Vaccinium macrocarpon capsule may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high acidity and active compounds.</p>
