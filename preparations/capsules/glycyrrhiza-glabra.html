<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra capsule has been used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments for centuries in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its expectorant properties and its ability to soothe inflammation in the throat and lungs. In modern times, it is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent, often in combination with other herbs for conditions like colds, bronchitis, and skin disorders. It is also used in some formulations to support adrenal function and as a mild corticosteroid alternative.</p>
<p>However, long-term use can lead to side effects such as hypertension, so it should be used under professional guidance.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra capsule has health benefits such as reducing inflammation, supporting respiratory health, and aiding in the treatment of digestive issues.</p>
<p>It contains glycyrrhizin, which has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that may help in managing conditions like colds, coughs, and viral infections. The capsule form makes it convenient for daily use and allows for consistent dosing. It may also help regulate the body's stress response by influencing cortisol levels.</p>
<p>However, long-term use should be monitored due to potential side effects like hypertension.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra capsule active constituents include glycyrrhizin, flavonoids, saponins, and various phytoestrogens.</p>
<p>Glycyrrhizin is the primary bioactive compound responsible for the herb's anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Flavonoids contribute to its antioxidant effects, helping to neutralize free radicals in the body. Saponins may support immune function and have mild expectorant properties.</p>
<p>These constituents collectively make Glycyrrhiza glabra capsules useful for respiratory support, stress management, and immune system enhancement.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Glycyrrhiza glabra capsule, first gather dried Glycyrrhiza glabra root, which is the primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Clean the root thoroughly and cut it into small pieces to increase surface area for extraction. Place the root in a pot with water and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Strain the liquid and allow it to cool, then mix with a binding agent like honey or gum arabic to form a paste.</p>
<p>Finally, use a capsule-making machine or hand-capsule method to encase the paste into individual capsules.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra capsule may lead to increased blood pressure, fluid retention, and decreased potassium levels.</p>
<p>This herbal preparation contains glycyrrhizin, which can act as a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, mimicking the effects of aldosterone. Prolonged use may cause hypertension, heart failure, and electrolyte imbalances. It is contraindicated in individuals with hypertension, heart disease, or those on diuretics.</p>
<p>Side effects may also include headaches, dizziness, and gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>
