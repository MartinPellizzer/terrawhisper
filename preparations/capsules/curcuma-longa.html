<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>To make Curcuma longa capsule, first gather the necessary ingredients, including fresh or dried turmeric rhizomes, a capsule-making machine or molds, and a drying apparatus.</p>
<p>Clean and slice the turmeric rhizomes into thin pieces to facilitate extraction. Place the slices in a container and submerge them in a mixture of water and alcohol to create a tincture, allowing it to steep for several weeks. Once the tincture is ready, strain it through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove any solids.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the liquid into the capsule molds and allow them to dry completely before use.</p>

<p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting curcuma longa supplementation, especially if taking other medications or having underlying health issues.</p>
