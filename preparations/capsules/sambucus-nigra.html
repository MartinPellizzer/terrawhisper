<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra capsule has been used to treat a variety of ailments across different cultures for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued in European traditional medicine for its purported ability to alleviate symptoms of the flu and respiratory infections. In traditional practices, it was also used to support the immune system and as a remedy for fever and inflammation. Modern research has explored its potential antiviral and antioxidant properties, leading to its use in contemporary herbal supplements for immune support.</p>
<p>However, caution is advised due to potential toxicity if not prepared or consumed properly.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

This preparation is often used to alleviate symptoms of colds and flu due to its antiviral properties. Additionally, it may help lower cholesterol levels and improve circulation.</p>
<p>Sambucus nigra capsules are also believed to have anti-cancer properties, though more research is needed to confirm these effects.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra capsule active constituents include flavonoids, anthocyanins, polysaccharides, and essential oils.</p>
<p>These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating properties. Flavonoids and anthocyanins contribute to the plant's ability to neutralize free radicals and support cardiovascular health. Polysaccharides may enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells.</p>
<p>Essential oils provide additional antimicrobial and antiviral benefits, making Sambucus nigra a popular choice for supporting respiratory and immune health.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Sambucus nigra capsule, first gather fresh or dried elderberry fruits, then clean and hull them.</p>
<p>Next, simmer the berries in water for about 30 minutes to create a syrup. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove solids. Allow the syrup to cool and then pour it into capsule molds.</p>
<p>Finally, let the capsules dry completely before storing them in a cool, dark place.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Sambucus nigra capsule may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high mucilage content.</p>
<p>It can also cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the plant, manifesting as rash, itching, or swelling. Long-term use may interfere with blood sugar levels, making it potentially unsafe for diabetics. Some studies suggest it might affect the central nervous system, leading to dizziness or drowsiness.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may interact with medications such as anticoagulants, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
