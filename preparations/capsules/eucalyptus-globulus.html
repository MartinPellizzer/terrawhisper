<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>

<p>These capsules are commonly used to support respiratory health by helping to relieve symptoms of colds, coughs, and bronchitis.

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Eucalyptus globulus capsule, first gather dried eucalyptus leaves and grind them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</p>
<p>Next, measure out the desired amount of powder, typically 1 teaspoon per capsule, and ensure it is free from any large particles. Then, use a capsule filler or a small pill-making machine to insert the powder into gelatin capsules, making sure to fill them evenly. Allow the capsules to dry completely in a cool, dark place to preserve their potency.</p>
<p>Finally, store the capsules in an airtight container away from moisture and direct sunlight to maintain their effectiveness.</p>

In high doses, it may interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants, increasing the risk of bleeding.</p>
