<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Vaccinium myrtillus capsule, first gather fresh or dried blueberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) and clean them thoroughly.</p>
<p>Next, crush the blueberries into a fine paste using a mortar and pestle or a blender. Then, strain the mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove seeds and pulp, leaving behind a smooth liquid. Allow the liquid to simmer gently over low heat for about 15 minutes to reduce it slightly.</p>
<p>Finally, pour the reduced liquid into small capsules and let them dry completely before use.</p>
