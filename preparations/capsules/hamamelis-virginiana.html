<p>Historically, Native American tribes utilized the bark of the witch hazel plant for its astringent properties, applying it to soothe irritated skin and reduce inflammation. In traditional herbal medicine, it was also used to relieve symptoms of hemorrhoids and as a topical remedy for minor burns and cuts. Modern applications include its use in over-the-counter products for skin care, as an anti-inflammatory agent, and in formulations for digestive and urinary tract support.</p>
<p>Today, the capsule form provides a convenient way to consume the plant's active compounds for both internal and external therapeutic purposes.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>

<p>This herbal preparation is commonly used for its potential benefits in skin care and wound healing.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Hamamelis virginiana capsule, first collect dried Hamamelis virginiana flowers, then grind them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</p>
<p>Next, measure out the desired amount of powder and mix it with a small amount of a binding agent such as rice flour or cornstarch to help hold the mixture together. Shape the mixture into small, uniform capsules using a capsule-making machine or by hand using pill molds.</p>
<p>Finally, allow the capsules to dry completely in a cool, dark place before storing them in an airtight container.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
