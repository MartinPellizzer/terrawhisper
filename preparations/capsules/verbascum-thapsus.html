<p>Wash the plant material thoroughly and chop it into small pieces to facilitate extraction. Steep the chopped plant in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes to create a strong infusion, then strain the liquid to remove solids. Allow the infusion to cool and mix it with a binding agent like honey or a plant-based binder to form a paste.</p>
<p>Finally, press the paste into small capsules using a capsule-making machine or by hand, and let them dry completely before use.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Verbascum thapsus capsule may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to its high mucilage content.</p>

In some cases, it may interact with medications, especially those affecting the kidneys or liver, increasing the risk of adverse effects.</p>
