<h2 id="0">Uses</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata capsule has been used to treat various ailments in traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine for centuries.</p>
<p>Historically, it was valued for its bitter taste and was used to alleviate symptoms of fever, inflammation, and digestive issues. In modern times, it is commonly used as a dietary supplement to support immune function and reduce the severity of cold and flu symptoms. Scientific studies have shown that its active compound, andrographolide, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Today, it is widely available in capsule form and is often recommended for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2 id="1">Benefits</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata capsule has health benefits such as boosting the immune system, reducing fever, and alleviating symptoms of the common cold.</p>
<p>It contains andrographolides, which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This herbal preparation may also support respiratory health and help combat viral infections. It is commonly used in traditional medicine to enhance overall wellness and reduce the severity of infections.</p>
<p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those taking other medications.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata capsule active constituents include andrographolide, neoandrographolide, and deoxyandrographolide, which are lactone derivatives known for their potent medicinal properties.</p>
<p>These compounds exhibit strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, making them valuable for supporting immune function and reducing oxidative stress. Andrographolide, in particular, is recognized for its ability to enhance the body's natural defenses against viral infections, including the common cold. The herbal preparation is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of respiratory infections and boost overall wellness.</p>
<p>Its active components also show potential in managing conditions such as fever, sore throat, and digestive issues.</p>

<h2 id="3">Preparation</h2>
<p>To make Andrographis paniculata capsule, first gather dried Andrographis paniculata leaves, which are the primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Next, grind the dried leaves into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder. Then, mix the powder with a small amount of water to create a thick paste, ensuring all the powder is moistened. Afterward, shape the paste into small, uniform capsules using a capsule-making machine or by hand.</p>
<p>Finally, allow the capsules to dry completely in a cool, dry place to preserve their potency and shelf life.</p>

<h2 id="4">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Andrographis paniculata capsule may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in some individuals.</p>
<p>It can also cause headaches, dizziness, and skin rashes as potential side effects. The herb may interact with certain medications, such as immunosuppressants or anticoagulants, increasing the risk of adverse effects. Long-term use might lead to liver toxicity in rare cases, though more research is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting this herbal preparation, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
