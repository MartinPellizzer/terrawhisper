<p>Swollen feet is a common condition characterized by inflammation and puffiness of the feet, often caused by poor circulation, standing or walking for extended periods, or underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been widely used to treat swollen feet due to their anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and soothing properties.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Ginger, Turmeric, and Epsom Salt are commonly used to reduce inflammation and promote blood flow, while herbs like Calendula, Aloe Vera, and Chamomile are applied topically to soothe and calm the skin.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like teas, infusions, and poultices made from herbs like Willow Bark, Meadowsweet, and Plantain are also effective in treating swollen feet, as they help to reduce pain, swelling, and discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes swollen feet?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of swollen feet are fluid retention and poor circulation, which can be due to underlying medical conditions such as kidney disease, heart failure, or liver disease.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include standing or sitting for long periods, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the feet due to gravity, and wearing tight shoes that constrict blood flow.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing swollen feet include a diet high in salt and sugar, as well as a sedentary lifestyle that involves minimal physical activity.</p>
<p>Additionally, living in hot and humid climates or working in jobs that involve standing for extended periods, such as nursing or retail, can also contribute to swollen feet.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal swollen feet?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat swollen feet are often rich in anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties, which help to reduce swelling and fluid retention.</p>
<p>Examples of such herbs include Cleavers (Galium aparine), which has a diuretic action that helps to flush out excess fluids, and Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help to reduce swelling and protect the veins.</p>
<p>These herbs also contain bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and saponins, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help to alleviate swelling and promote healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like Wild Indigo (Baptisia tinctoria) and Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties that help to reduce inflammation and prevent infection in swollen feet.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat swollen feet?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat swollen feet are a blend of teas, infusions, and poultices that help to reduce inflammation and promote blood circulation.</p>
<p>Drinking a warm tea made from a combination of plants with anti-inflammatory properties can help to alleviate swelling, while a cooling infusion can be applied topically to bring down the temperature of the affected area.</p>
<p>A soothing poultice made from a mixture of plants that have a diuretic effect can help to reduce fluid retention, while a warm compress made from a blend of plants that promote blood flow can be used to massage the feet and improve circulation.</p>
<p>Additionally, a bath soak made from a combination of herbs with antiseptic properties can help to cleanse the feet and reduce the risk of infection.</p>
