By promoting the detoxification of the reproductive system, they may help restore normal menstrual function in women with hormonal imbalances. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using these herbs, as they can interact with medications or have varying effects based on individual health conditions.</p><p>Overall, herbal mucillages offer a natural approach to managing amenorrhea, though their efficacy may vary and should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan.</p><div class="toc">
