<h2 id="1">1. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and is often recommended for women experiencing amenorrhea, which is the absence of menstrual periods.</p><p>The active compounds in vitex, such as flavonoids and iridoids, are believed to influence the pituitary gland and regulate the production of luteinizing hormone, which can help restore regular menstrual cycles. Clinical studies suggest that vitex may be effective in improving menstrual regularity, particularly in cases where amenorrhea is related to hormonal imbalances or stress. Herbal capsules containing standardized vitex extract are available and are typically taken as a supplement, with dosages ranging from 40 to 100 mg per day, depending on the formulation and individual needs.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for women with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Cimicifuga racemosa</h2><img alt="cimicifuga racemosa capsule" src="/images/preparations/cimicifuga-racemosa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cimicifuga racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support women's health, particularly for symptoms related to menopause.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Cimicifuga racemosa are often used to address amenorrhea, or the absence of menstrual periods, by potentially regulating hormonal imbalances. Studies suggest that the herb may influence estrogen receptors and support uterine function, which can help restore menstrual cycles in some women. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, as it may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>While Cimicifuga racemosa may offer natural relief for amenorrhea, it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Herbal capsules containing Leonurus cardiaca are often used as a natural alternative to conventional treatments, though their efficacy can vary. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these capsules, especially for women with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest possible benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its role in managing amenorrhea.</p><h2 id="4">4. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica capsule" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its possible role in managing amenorrhea, which is the absence of menstrual periods.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Urtica dioica are believed to support hormonal balance and uterine health, which may help regulate menstrual cycles.

Herbal capsules containing Paeonia lactiflora are often formulated with other herbs to enhance their efficacy and provide a more comprehensive approach to menstrual health. These capsules are typically taken orally as a dietary supplement, and their use should be guided by a healthcare professional to ensure safety and appropriate dosing.</p><p>While some studies suggest promising results, more clinical research is needed to fully establish the effectiveness of Paeonia lactiflora in managing amenorrhea.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thistle, is traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance and address menstrual irregularities such as amenorrhea.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Cnicus benedictus are often formulated to promote uterine health and stimulate menstrual flow by enhancing the body's natural regulatory processes. These capsules are typically taken as a supplement under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for women experiencing prolonged absence of menstruation. The herb is believed to work by supporting liver function and improving the metabolism of hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, it is important to consult with a qualified practitioner before using Cnicus benedictus for amenorrhea, as individual responses and interactions with other medications may vary.</p><h2 id="7">7. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance and menstrual health.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing glycyrrhiza glabra are often considered for the management of amenorrhea, as they may help regulate menstrual cycles by influencing the endocrine system. The herb is believed to possess anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic properties that can support the body's ability to manage stress, which is a common contributor to irregular or absent menstruation. However, it is important to note that while some studies suggest potential benefits, more rigorous clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy for amenorrhea.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement that has been traditionally used for its potential liver-supporting properties.</p><p>While it is well-researched for its role in liver health, its use for treating amenorrhea, or the absence of menstruation, is less established. Some preliminary studies suggest that the active compound silymarin in milk thistle may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that could potentially influence hormonal balance. However, there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy specifically for amenorrhea, and more research is needed to confirm its role in menstrual regulation.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with hormonal disorders or those undergoing medical treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9. Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare capsule" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-capsules.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in regulating menstrual cycles.</p><p>Fennel herbal capsules are often recommended for women experiencing amenorrhea, as they contain compounds like anethol that may help stimulate uterine contractions and promote hormonal balance. These capsules are typically made from dried fennel seeds and are available in various formulations, often standardized for potency. While some studies suggest fennel may support menstrual health, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or on medication.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, individual responses can vary, and it should be used as part of a holistic approach to women's health.</p><h2 id="10">10.

While scientific research on its direct effects on amenorrhea is limited, some studies suggest that Rhodiola rosea may help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, potentially influencing reproductive hormone levels. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Rhodiola rosea, especially for individuals with hormonal disorders or those undergoing medical treatment.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Rhodiola rosea capsules may offer supportive benefits when used alongside conventional treatments for amenorrhea.</p>
