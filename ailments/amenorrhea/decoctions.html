Many women find these natural remedies to be gentle and effective, though they should be used under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p><p>While herbal decoctions can be a valuable complementary therapy, they should not replace professional medical evaluation, especially if amenorrhea is caused by an underlying health issue.</p><div class="toc">

Clinical studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that vitex may be beneficial for women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea or those experiencing stress-related menstrual suppression.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex, especially for individuals with existing hormonal conditions or those on medications, to ensure safe and effective use.</p><h2 id="2">2.
