However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using this herb, especially if there are underlying medical conditions or if taking other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating amenorrhea.</p><h2 id="2">2.
