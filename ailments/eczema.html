<p>Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and scaly patches on the skin, often resulting from genetic, environmental, or immune system factors.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to treat eczema for centuries, offering a natural and effective approach to alleviate symptoms and promote skin health.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as Aloe vera, Calendula, and Chamomile are known for their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, which help to calm and heal eczema-prone skin.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like topical creams and ointments infused with herbs like Tea tree oil, Lavender, and Gotu kola can help to reduce inflammation, promote skin regeneration, and even out skin tone, while internal herbal remedies like Turmeric, Ginger, and Milk thistle can help to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation from within.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes eczema?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of eczema are genetic and environmental factors, with genetic predisposition being the main trigger, as individuals with a family history of eczema are more likely to develop the condition.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include stress, certain foods, and allergens such as pollen or pet dander, which can trigger or exacerbate eczema symptoms.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing eczema include exposure to harsh soaps and detergents, poor diet, and lack of sleep, which can weaken the skin's natural barrier and make it more susceptible to irritation.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with a history of respiratory issues or allergies, such as asthma or hay fever, are also more likely to develop eczema due to the underlying inflammation and immune system imbalances.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal eczema?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat eczema are Aloe vera, Calendula, and Chamomile, which have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that help to calm and reduce skin irritation.</p>
<p>Aloe vera's bioactive compounds, such as aloin and aloe-emodin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities that promote wound healing and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Calendula's triterpenoid saponins and flavonoids have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects that help to soothe and protect the skin.</p>
<p>Chamomile's apigenin and luteolin flavonoids also exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that contribute to the reduction of eczema symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat eczema?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat eczema are teas and infusions that have anti-inflammatory properties, such as a soothing bath tea that calms the skin, a topical ointment that reduces itching, and a calming drink that regulates the body's immune response.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations are also used as compresses or wraps to cool and moisturize the skin, while others are taken as capsules or tinctures to address internal imbalances that contribute to eczema.</p>
<p>Aromatic infusions, such as a calming steam inhalation, can also help to reduce stress and promote relaxation, which is essential for managing eczema symptoms.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal preparations, like a nourishing skin balm, can help to repair and protect the skin, reducing the severity and frequency of eczema outbreaks.</p>
