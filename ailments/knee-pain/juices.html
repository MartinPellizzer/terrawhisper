These juices may help reduce joint swelling and improve mobility by inhibiting inflammatory pathways in the body. To enhance absorption, turmeric is often combined with black pepper or healthy fats in the juice formulation.</p><p>While turmeric juice can be a supportive treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a primary remedy for chronic knee pain.</p><h2 id="2">2. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular choice for managing knee pain.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, ginger can help reduce inflammation and improve circulation, which may alleviate discomfort associated with conditions like osteoarthritis. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, are believed to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines in the body. To prepare ginger juice, fresh ginger root is typically peeled, sliced, and blended with water or juice, then strained for consumption.</p><p>While ginger juice may offer natural relief for knee pain, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment, especially if other medical conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="3">3.

While scientific evidence is still emerging, preliminary studies suggest that the active compound silymarin in milk thistle may contribute to improved joint function and reduced discomfort. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these juices, as they may interact with medications or have side effects for certain individuals.</p><p>Overall, Silybum marianum herbal juices are considered a natural complement to conventional treatments for knee pain, though more research is needed to fully understand their efficacy.</p><h2 id="5">5.
