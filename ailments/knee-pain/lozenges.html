However, certain herbal formulations may be marketed with a broad range of health claims, including joint support, which could potentially appeal to individuals with knee pain. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal product for knee pain to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><p>Overall, while herbal lozenges may offer some general wellness benefits, they are not a targeted treatment for knee pain and should not replace conventional medical care.</p>
