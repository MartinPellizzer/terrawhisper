While it is not a cure for asthma, some research suggests that eucalyptus tea may help alleviate symptoms by acting as a natural bronchodilator and decongestant. However, it should be used cautiously and in consultation with a healthcare provider, as it may interact with medications or cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>Incorporating eucalyptus globulus herbal tea into a holistic approach to asthma care may offer complementary relief, but it should not replace prescribed medical treatments.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The active compounds in licorice, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, may have bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects that support respiratory health. However, excessive consumption of licorice tea can lead to side effects like high blood pressure due to its natural corticosteroid-like properties.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, licorice root tea may be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to support asthma management.</p><h2 id="7">7.
