<h2 id="1">1. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla tea" src="/images/preparations/matricaria-chamomilla-teas.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a popular herbal tea known for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Chamomile tea is often used to alleviate eye swelling due to its high concentration of antioxidants and flavonoids, which help reduce inflammation and soothe irritated tissues. To use it for eye swelling, the tea can be cooled and applied as a compress or consumed regularly to promote overall relaxation and reduce stress-related puffiness. Its mild sedative effect also supports better sleep, which can further reduce morning eye swelling.</p><p>While generally safe, individuals with allergies to plants in the daisy family should exercise caution when using chamomile.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it may help reduce eye swelling by promoting lymphatic drainage and reducing fluid retention around the eyes. The tea contains compounds such as silica and antioxidants that support overall eye health and may alleviate puffiness. However, it is important to use it in moderation and consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a regimen, especially for those with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports its use for eye swelling, more scientific research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><h2 id="3">3. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tea" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-teas.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tea, it is believed to help reduce eye swelling due to its high concentration of silica and other minerals that may support tissue repair and drainage. While some anecdotal evidence suggests it may alleviate puffiness around the eyes, scientific research on its efficacy for this specific use is limited. It is often recommended to use it in combination with other herbs like chamomile or green tea for enhanced benefits.</p><p>However, individuals should consult a healthcare provider before using horsetail tea, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some cases.</p><h2 id="4">4. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, rosehip can help reduce eye swelling by soothing the delicate tissues around the eyes and promoting drainage. The high vitamin C content in rosehip supports the body's natural healing processes and may help alleviate puffiness caused by allergies or fatigue. Additionally, the mild diuretic effect of rosehip tea can help reduce fluid retention, which is often a contributing factor to under-eye swelling.</p><p>Regular consumption of rosa canina herbal tea may offer a natural and gentle way to support eye health and reduce morning puffiness.</p><h2 id="5">5. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita tea" src="/images/preparations/chamomilla-recutita-teas.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is widely used in herbal teas for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When consumed as a tea, it can help reduce eye swelling by promoting relaxation and decreasing inflammation around the delicate eye area. The active compounds in chamomile, such as apigenin and bisabolol, have been shown to have soothing effects on the skin and mucous membranes. To use it for eye swelling, some people apply cooled chamomile tea as a compress or drink it regularly to support overall wellness.</p><p>While generally safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile, especially for those with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal teas for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its antidepressant effects, some studies suggest it may help reduce inflammation and promote healing, which could potentially alleviate eye swelling. The active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hypericin and flavonoids, are believed to contribute to its calming and anti-inflammatory effects. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it for eye-related issues, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy for treating eye swelling specifically.</p><h2 id="7">7. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, contains bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and improve circulation, potentially alleviating eye swelling.</p><p>Herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis are often consumed for their calming and detoxifying properties, which can support overall eye health. Some studies suggest that the caffeine and antioxidants in these teas may help reduce puffiness by decreasing fluid retention around the eyes. While not a substitute for medical treatment, these teas can be part of a holistic approach to managing mild eye swelling.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially for persistent or severe cases.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, it is believed to help reduce eye swelling by promoting the drainage of fluids and reducing irritation. The plant contains compounds that may support the healing of minor eye inflammations and allergic reactions. To prepare the tea, steep a teaspoon of dried blessed thorn in hot water for several minutes.</p><p>While it may offer some relief, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it for persistent or severe eye conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum tea" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-teas.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting liver function and reducing inflammation.</p><p>While it is primarily known for its hepatoprotective properties, some studies suggest that its active compound, silymarin, may have anti-inflammatory effects that could help reduce eye swelling. Herbal teas made from silybum marianum are often consumed for their antioxidant properties, which may contribute to overall eye health and reduce irritation. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum tea to the reduction of eye swelling.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tea" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-teas.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal teas for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, lavender can help reduce eye swelling by soothing the delicate tissues around the eyes and promoting relaxation. The essential oils in lavender possess natural antiseptic and decongestant qualities that may alleviate puffiness and redness. This herb is particularly beneficial for those experiencing eye strain or mild inflammation due to allergies or lack of sleep.</p><p>To use lavender tea for eye swelling, it can be cooled and applied as a compress or consumed regularly to support overall eye health.</p>
