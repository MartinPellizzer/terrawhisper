The essential oils in chamomile possess mild analgesic and antiseptic qualities, which may aid in relieving redness and discomfort. To use chamomile baths for eye swelling, steep a handful of dried chamomile flowers in hot water for several minutes before adding it to a basin of warm water.</p><p>While generally safe, it is advisable to perform a patch test and consult a healthcare professional if you have sensitive skin or underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/rosa-canina-baths.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for its anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing properties.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, rosehip can help reduce eye swelling by soothing the delicate skin around the eyes and promoting circulation.

To prepare a rosehip bath, simply mix a few drops of rosehip oil into warm water and let the eyes rest in the water for a few minutes.</p><p>While it is generally safe, it is advisable to perform a patch test before using it extensively to avoid any allergic reactions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/urtica-dioica-baths.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to alleviate symptoms such as eye swelling.</p><p>The plant contains compounds like histamine and formic acid, which can cause a tingling sensation when applied to the skin, potentially promoting circulation and reducing inflammation. When used in a bath, stinging nettle can help soothe irritated tissues around the eyes and reduce puffiness. However, it is important to dilute the plant properly to avoid skin irritation, as direct application can be too strong.</p><p>While some people find relief from using stinging nettle baths for eye swelling, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before trying this remedy, especially if there are underlying health conditions or allergies.</p><h2 id="4">4. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/equisetum-arvense-baths.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsehair grass, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to alleviate eye swelling due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When infused into warm water, the bath helps reduce puffiness and irritation around the eyes by promoting circulation and soothing the delicate skin. The plant contains silica and various bioactive compounds that may support the healing of minor skin irritations and reduce fluid retention. Herbal baths with Equisetum arvense are often recommended as a natural remedy for conditions like allergic conjunctivitis or mild eye strain.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using this remedy, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or existing eye conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/hypericum-perforatum-baths.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to alleviate symptoms such as eye swelling.</p><p>The plant contains bioactive compounds like hypericin and hyperforin, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. To prepare a St. John's Wort bath, dried flowers are steeped in hot water and then used to soak a cloth, which is applied to the eyes. This method is thought to provide a soothing effect and reduce puffiness around the eyes.</p><p>While generally considered safe for topical use, individuals should consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's Wort, especially if they are on medication, due to its potential interactions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/achillea-millefolium-baths.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, it can help reduce eye swelling by promoting circulation and soothing irritated tissues around the eyes. To prepare an eye swelling bath, steep a handful of dried yarrow flowers in boiling water for about 15 minutes, then allow the solution to cool to a comfortable temperature before using it as a compress or gentle wash. This natural remedy is particularly beneficial for those with mild allergic reactions or irritations causing puffiness around the eyes.</p><p>However, it is important to perform a patch test first and consult with a healthcare provider if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="7">7. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/silybum-marianum-baths.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal baths, silybum marianum may help reduce eye swelling by promoting circulation and soothing irritations around the delicate eye area. The active compound, silymarin, is believed to support liver function, which can indirectly contribute to reducing fluid retention and puffiness. To use it for eye swelling, a few drops of silybum marianum extract can be added to warm bath water, allowing the skin to absorb its beneficial properties.</p><p>While herbal baths may offer some relief, they should complement, not replace, professional medical advice for persistent or severe eye swelling.</p><h2 id="8">8. English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/lavandula-angustifolia-baths.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, has been traditionally used for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a popular choice for herbal baths aimed at reducing eye swelling.</p><p>When infused into bath water, lavender essential oil or dried lavender flowers can help calm the nervous system and ease tension around the eyes, which often contributes to puffiness. The aromatic compounds in lavender may also promote relaxation, indirectly helping to reduce stress-related eye swelling. Additionally, the gentle warmth of the bath can improve circulation, aiding in the drainage of excess fluid from the under-eye area.</p><p>For best results, it is recommended to use a small amount of lavender-infused water and gently cleanse the face, followed by a cool compress to further reduce swelling.</p><h2 id="9">9. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/chamomilla-recutita-baths.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as chamomile, is a gentle herbal remedy often used in herbal baths to alleviate symptoms such as eye swelling.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory and soothing properties of chamomile can help reduce puffiness and redness around the eyes when used in a warm infusion. To prepare a chamomile bath, steep a handful of dried chamomile flowers in hot water for several minutes, then allow the liquid to cool slightly before using it as a compress or adding it to a warm bath. This method is particularly beneficial for those seeking natural relief from eye swelling caused by allergies, fatigue, or minor irritations.</p><p>Regular use of chamomile baths can promote relaxation and improve overall eye comfort.</p><h2 id="10">10. Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/camellia-sinensis-baths.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to reduce eye swelling due to its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, the compounds in camellia sinensis, such as polyphenols and antioxidants, can help alleviate puffiness and redness around the eyes by improving circulation and reducing fluid retention. These herbal baths provide a gentle, natural alternative to commercial eye treatments, offering a calming effect that promotes relaxation and skin rejuvenation. The mild temperature of the bath further enhances the absorption of beneficial compounds, making it an effective method for soothing tired or irritated eyes.</p><p>Regular use of camellia sinensis herbal baths may contribute to long-term improvement in eye health and appearance.</p>
