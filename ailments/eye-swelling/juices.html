<h2 id="1">1. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential candidate for reducing eye swelling.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, stinging nettle is believed to support the body's natural healing processes and may help alleviate puffiness around the eyes. The juice is typically made by juicing fresh leaves and consuming it regularly, though it should be used with caution due to its potential to cause allergic reactions. Some proponents claim that the high nutrient content, including vitamins and minerals, can improve overall eye health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle juice for eye swelling, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a natural remedy that has been traditionally used for its high content of vitamin C and antioxidants, which can support overall eye health.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, rosa canina may help reduce eye swelling by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The bioactive compounds in rosehip juice, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, contribute to its ability to soothe irritated tissues around the eyes. Many people use rosa canina juice as a gentle, natural alternative to commercial eye treatments for conditions like puffiness or mild allergic reactions.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting liver function.</p><p>While it is commonly recognized for its liver-protective properties, some studies suggest that its active compound, silymarin, may have anti-inflammatory effects that could potentially help reduce eye swelling. Herbal juices made from silybum marianum are sometimes used in alternative medicine to address various inflammatory conditions, including those affecting the eyes. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum juice to eye swelling reduction is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for this purpose.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using silybum marianum for eye-related concerns.</p><h2 id="4">4. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/hypericum-perforatum-juices.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal plant traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential benefits for eye health.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its effects on mood and mild depression, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help reduce eye swelling. When prepared as a herbal juice, hypericum perforatum can be applied topically to the eyes to soothe irritation and inflammation. However, it is important to note that the use of this herb for eye conditions should be approached with caution, as it may interact with certain medications and cause photosensitivity.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort for any medical condition, including eye swelling.</p><h2 id="5">5. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/matricaria-chamomilla-juices.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a herbal remedy often used in the form of juice to address various health issues, including eye swelling.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of chamomile juice are believed to help reduce puffiness and irritation around the eyes. When applied topically as a compress, chamomile juice can soothe inflammation and promote healing of the delicate eye area. It is often recommended for individuals experiencing allergic reactions, fatigue, or minor infections that cause under-eye swelling.</p><p>However, it is important to dilute the juice with water to avoid irritation and consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing eye conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/achillea-millefolium-juices.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>While it is not typically used as a direct juice for eye swelling, some herbal practitioners may recommend diluted yarrow tinctures or infusions to reduce inflammation and soothe the delicate eye area. The plant contains compounds like azulene and essential oils that may help in reducing puffiness and irritation. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow for eye-related conditions, as improper use can cause irritation or allergic reactions.</p><p>Overall, while yarrow may offer some supportive benefits, it should not replace conventional treatments for eye swelling.</p><h2 id="7">7. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/equisetum-arvense-juices.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it may help reduce eye swelling by promoting fluid drainage and reducing inflammation around the eye area. The high concentration of silica in equisetum arvense supports tissue repair and can aid in the healing process of irritated or swollen eyes. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence suggests potential benefits, more scientific research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness for eye swelling.</p><h2 id="8">8. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/aloe-barbadensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been widely used for its soothing and healing properties, including its potential benefits for eye swelling.</p><p>The gel extracted from the aloe plant contains anti-inflammatory compounds that may help reduce puffiness and irritation around the eyes. When used as a herbal juice, aloe vera can be applied topically or consumed internally to support overall eye health. However, it is important to ensure that the juice is properly prepared and diluted to avoid any adverse reactions.</p><p>While some people find relief from eye swelling using aloe vera juice, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its effects on hormonal balance.</p><p>While it is not typically marketed as a remedy for eye swelling, some herbal practitioners suggest that its anti-inflammatory and calming properties may help reduce puffiness around the eyes. The juice extracted from the ripe berries is believed to contain compounds that could support lymphatic drainage and reduce fluid retention, which are often contributors to under-eye swelling. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking vitex agnus-castus juice to the treatment of eye swelling, and it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it for such purposes.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses can vary, and it should be used as part of a holistic approach to health.</p><h2 id="10">10. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as St. Benedict's thorn or groundsel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking Cnicus benedictus to the reduction of eye swelling, some anecdotal reports suggest that its extracts may help alleviate inflammation when used as part of a holistic approach. Herbal juices made from this plant are sometimes recommended for their purported ability to detoxify the body and reduce puffiness around the eyes. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially for conditions like eye swelling that may have underlying medical causes.</p><p>Overall, while Cnicus benedictus may offer some natural benefits, it should not replace conventional medical treatment for serious eye issues.</p>
