Many herbal formulations also include vitamins like C and E, which support skin health and may enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>While some users report noticeable improvements in eye appearance, results can vary, and these capsules should not replace medical advice or treatment for serious eye conditions.</p>
