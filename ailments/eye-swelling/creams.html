The active compounds in chamomile, such as bisabolol and chamazulene, help to calm irritated skin and reduce puffiness around the eyes. When applied topically, chamomile-based creams can provide a gentle and natural remedy for mild eye swelling caused by allergies, fatigue, or minor irritations.</p><p>However, it is important to perform a patch test before using these products to avoid any potential allergic reactions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These natural creams are often preferred by individuals seeking alternatives to conventional pharmaceutical treatments. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially around sensitive areas like the eyes.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for eye-related conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/rosa-canina-creams.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a natural ingredient often used in herbal creams for its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties.</p><p>These creams are typically formulated with rosehip oil, which is rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants that can help reduce eye swelling and dark circles. The anti-inflammatory compounds in rosa canina may help soothe irritation and promote skin healing around the delicate eye area. Many users report improved skin texture and reduced puffiness after consistent use of rosa canina-based eye creams.</p><p>However, it is important to perform a patch test before applying these creams to ensure no allergic reaction occurs.</p><h2 id="4">4.

The aromatic compounds in lavender may help alleviate irritation and promote a sense of relaxation, which can indirectly reduce puffiness. When applied gently around the eyes, lavender-based creams can provide a natural alternative to conventional treatments for mild swelling.</p><p>However, it is important to perform a patch test first, as some individuals may be sensitive to lavender ingredients.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The active compounds in Vitis vinifera, such as resveratrol, help in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which can contribute to under-eye bags and dark circles.</p><p>While these natural remedies can provide gentle relief, they should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to eye care, including proper sleep and hydration.</p><h2 id="6">6.

When formulated into creams, hypericum perforatum may offer localized relief for conditions like eye swelling by reducing redness and irritation. However, it is important to note that the use of such creams around the eyes should be approached with caution due to the risk of photosensitivity and potential interactions with other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using hypericum perforatum cream for eye-related issues.</p><h2 id="7">7.

These creams may contain extracts of the plant's seeds, which are believed to support tissue repair and reduce redness. While some studies suggest that silybum marianum may have beneficial effects on skin health, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for specific conditions like eye swelling.</p><p>As with any topical treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/equisetum-arvense-creams.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a herb rich in silica and other minerals that may support skin health.</p><p>Herbal creams containing equisetum arvense are often used to reduce eye swelling due to their anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.
