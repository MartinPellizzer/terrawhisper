To prepare a decoction, the herbs are typically simmered in water for an extended period to extract their active compounds. This method allows for the gradual release of beneficial compounds that can help reduce cramping, bloating, and other symptoms associated with digestive issues.</p><p>While herbal decoctions can be effective for mild to moderate abdominal pain, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for chronic or severe conditions.</p>
