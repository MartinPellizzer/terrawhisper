<p>Eye strain is a common condition characterized by physical fatigue and discomfort in the eyes, often caused by prolonged use of digital devices, reading, or other visual tasks.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat eye strain, offering a natural and effective solution to alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as bilberry, chamomile, and feverfew are particularly beneficial in treating eye strain due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to soothe and protect the eyes.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye compresses infused with herbs like calendula, lavender, and ginkgo biloba can be used to reduce eye strain, while herbal teas like peppermint and green tea can help to relax the eyes and reduce fatigue.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes eye strain?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of eye strain are prolonged screen time, poor lighting, and focusing on a single point for an extended period, all of which cause fatigue and irritation in the eyes.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of eye strain include blue light emission from digital devices, dry air from air conditioning or heating systems, and physical posture issues, which can exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing eye strain include working long hours in front of a computer, gaming or watching videos for extended periods, and spending less time outdoors, as these activities and habits can lead to prolonged screen time and poor eye care.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people who work in environments with high levels of glare or have a family history of eye problems may also be more prone to eye strain.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal eye strain?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat eye strain are Eyebright and Bilberry, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that soothe and calm the eyes.</p>
<p>Eyebright contains flavonoids, such as quercetin, that reduce eye redness and irritation, while Bilberry contains anthocyanins that improve vision and reduce eye fatigue.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like Ginkgo Biloba and Passionflower have vasodilatory and sedative effects that can help relax the eyes and surrounding muscles, reducing strain and promoting relaxation.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in these herbs, including flavonoids, anthocyanins, and terpenoids, work together to protect the eyes from oxidative stress and promote overall eye health.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat eye strain?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat eye strain are decoctions made from flowers and leaves that have anti-inflammatory properties, soothing compresses prepared from cooled infusions of fruits and berries, and warm infusions taken as teas to relax the eye muscles.</p>
<p>These herbal remedies also include eye washes made from cooled infusions of roots and barks that calm the eyes and reduce redness.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like herbal oils and salves applied topically can also help to reduce eye strain by nourishing the skin around the eyes.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbal teas made from specific flowers and leaves can help to improve vision and reduce fatigue caused by prolonged screen time.</p>
