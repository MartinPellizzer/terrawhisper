<p>Sore eyes is a common eye disorder characterized by redness, itching, and discomfort in the eyes, often caused by exposure to environmental stressors, allergies, or infections.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been widely used to treat sore eyes due to their anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as aloe vera, calendula, and chamomile are effective in soothing and calming the eyes, reducing inflammation and promoting healing.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye drops made from echinacea, ginkgo biloba, and eyebright, as well as teas infused with peppermint, sage, and licorice root, can also provide relief from sore eyes by reducing inflammation, improving circulation, and protecting the eyes from further damage.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes sore eyes?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of sore eyes are dryness, overuse of digital devices, and exposure to harsh chemicals or allergens, which can irritate the eyes and lead to inflammation.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of sore eyes include prolonged reading, smoking, and certain medical conditions such as conjunctivitis or blepharitis, which can exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p>Individuals with desk jobs or those who spend extensive periods in front of screens are more likely to develop sore eyes due to prolonged strain on their eyes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people who work in environments with high levels of dust or chemicals are also at a higher risk of developing sore eyes due to prolonged exposure.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal sore eyes?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat sore eyes are rich in bioactive compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, providing relief from the discomfort and redness associated with this condition.</p>
<p>Examples of such herbs include Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), which have been traditionally used to soothe and calm irritated eyes.</p>
<p>Eyebright contains flavonoids like rutin and quercetin, which have anti-inflammatory effects that help to reduce swelling and alleviate pain, while Licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, an anti-inflammatory compound that helps to reduce redness and irritation.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like Calendula (Calendula officinalis) have been used to treat sore eyes, with its triterpenoid saponins exhibiting antimicrobial properties that help to prevent infection and promote healing.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat sore eyes?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat sore eyes are a variety of teas, infusions, and compresses that help to soothe and calm the affected area.</p>
<p>A warm compress made with a specific type of infusion can help to reduce swelling and ease the discomfort, while a cooled tea can be used as an eye wash to reduce redness and inflammation.</p>
<p>Another type of infusion can be applied as a poultice to the affected area to draw out impurities and promote healing, and a specific herbal tea can be used to calm the nerves and reduce stress that may be exacerbating the condition.</p>
<p>Additionally, a chilled infusion can be used as a compress to cool and calm the eyes, reducing the discomfort and promoting a sense of relief.</p>
