These lotions are believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial qualities that may help reduce swelling and infection in the ear canal. Some individuals use sage lotions as a natural alternative to conventional treatments for temporary ear blockage caused by wax buildup or irritation.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially in the ears, to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><h2 id="2">2.
