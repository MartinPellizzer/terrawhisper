These decoctions are believed to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, potentially reducing estrogen levels and alleviating breast discomfort associated with fibrocystic changes. Clinical studies suggest that regular consumption of chasteberry decoctions may lead to improvements in breast tenderness and cyst size, though more research is needed to confirm long-term efficacy.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
