These oils are typically applied topically, diluted with a carrier oil, to target specific areas of the breast, though their effectiveness can vary among individuals. While some studies suggest they may offer symptomatic relief, more research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety in treating fibrocystic breast disease.</p><p>As with any complementary therapy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using essential oils, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are pregnant.</p>
