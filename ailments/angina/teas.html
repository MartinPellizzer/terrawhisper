<p>Herbal teas for Angina are a natural remedy that refers to the use of plant-based teas to alleviate the symptoms of angina, a condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart.</p>
<p>These herbal teas have been found to be beneficial in treating angina due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilating properties, which help to relax blood vessels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve overall cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas that have been used to treat angina include Ginkgo biloba, which improves blood flow and reduces inflammation; Hawthorn, which strengthens the heart and improves blood pressure; Turmeric, which reduces inflammation and oxidative stress; Ginger, which improves circulation and reduces pain; and Lavender, which helps to reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>By incorporating these herbal teas into their daily routine, individuals with angina may experience relief from symptoms, improved quality of life, and a reduced need for conventional medications.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>
According to "Lancet (London, England)", teas for angina may be beneficial due to their high flavonoid content, which has been shown to be inversely associated with mortality from coronary heart disease.
