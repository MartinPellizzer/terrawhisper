Herbal juices made from fresh garlic can support heart health by acting as a natural vasodilator, potentially easing chest pain associated with angina. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using garlic juice as a treatment, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>While garlic may offer some supportive benefits, it should not replace prescribed medical treatments for angina.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitis vinifera</h2><img alt="vitis vinifera juice" src="/images/preparations/vitis-vinifera-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitis vinifera, commonly known as the common grape vine, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits.</p><p>Herbal juices derived from Vitis vinifera, particularly those rich in resveratrol, may support heart health by improving blood flow and reducing oxidative stress. Some studies suggest that these juices could help manage symptoms of angina by enhancing nitric oxide production, which relaxes blood vessels. However, while preliminary research is promising, more clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for angina patients.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Vitis vinifera juices as a complementary therapy for angina.</p><h2 id="7">7.
