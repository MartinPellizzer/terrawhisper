Herbal tinctures made from Urtica dioica are often prepared by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds to be extracted. These tinctures are typically taken in small doses, and they are sometimes combined with other herbs to enhance their potential cardiovascular effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle tinctures, especially for individuals with heart conditions, as they may interact with medications or have unintended side effects.</p><h2 id="3">3.
