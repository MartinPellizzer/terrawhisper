Herbal lozenges containing Vitex agnus-castus are often marketed for their calming and supportive properties, though they are not a substitute for prescribed angina treatments. These lozenges may help alleviate mild symptoms by promoting relaxation and improving blood flow, but their efficacy in treating angina requires further clinical validation.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica lozenge" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its potential cardiovascular benefits, and herbal lozenges made from this plant may offer support for individuals with angina by promoting improved circulation and reducing inflammation.</p><p>These lozenges are typically formulated with a combination of Urtica dioica extract and other complementary herbs to enhance their therapeutic effects.
