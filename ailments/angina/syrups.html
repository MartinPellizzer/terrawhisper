While some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may improve symptoms of angina by dilating blood vessels, it is important to note that it should not replace prescribed medical treatments for heart conditions. Always consult with a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba, as it can interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting blood clotting or blood pressure.</p><p>Despite its historical use, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for angina remains limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential.</p><h2 id="5">5. Nymphaea alba</h2><img alt="nymphaea alba syrup" src="/images/preparations/nymphaea-alba-syrups.jpg"/><p>Nymphaea alba, commonly known as the white water lily, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from Nymphaea alba are believed to support heart health by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation.
