Herbal capsules containing hypericum perforatum are often used as complementary therapy, though they should not replace conventional medical treatments for serious eye infections. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using hypericum for eye conditions, as it can interact with other medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>Overall, while hypericum perforatum may offer some supportive benefits, its efficacy for eye infections remains under investigation and should be approached with caution.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to note that while aloe vera can be beneficial for topical application, its efficacy when taken orally for eye infections is not well-supported by extensive scientific research. Individuals experiencing persistent or severe eye infections should consult a healthcare professional rather than relying solely on herbal supplements.</p><p>As with any supplement, aloe barbadensis capsules should be used with caution and under the guidance of a qualified medical practitioner.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Herbal capsules containing silybum marianum are often marketed for general eye health and may be used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these capsules, especially if you have an existing eye infection or are taking other medications.</p><p>As with any supplement, the effectiveness and safety of silybum marianum can vary, and it should not replace prescribed medical treatments for eye infections.</p><h2 id="6">6.
