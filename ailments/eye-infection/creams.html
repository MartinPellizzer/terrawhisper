Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/vitex-agnus-castus-creams.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly used in tinctures or teas, some formulations incorporate it into topical creams for localized application.
