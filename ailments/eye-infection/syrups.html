Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum syrup" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with treating mild depression, some studies suggest it may have benefits for eye infections due to its ability to reduce inflammation and combat certain bacteria. Herbal syrups made from Hypericum perforatum can be used as a complementary therapy under the guidance of a healthcare professional. These syrups are often prepared by steeping the dried herb in a sugar syrup, creating a palatable form for easier consumption.</p><p>However, it is important to note that Hypericum perforatum can interact with various medications and should not be used as a substitute for conventional treatments without medical supervision.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Eucalyptus globulus</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus syrup" src="/images/preparations/eucalyptus-globulus-syrups.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus or gum tree, is often used in herbal syrups for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These syrups are traditionally prepared by extracting the essential oils from the leaves and combining them with a base of honey or glycerin to create a soothing and effective topical application.
