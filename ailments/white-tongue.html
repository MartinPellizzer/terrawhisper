<p>White tongue is a common condition characterized by a thick, white coating on the surface of the tongue, often caused by an overgrowth of bacteria or a fungal infection.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective way to treat white tongue, as they can help to reduce inflammation, promote healing, and restore the balance of the oral microbiome.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as aloe vera, sage, and peppermint have been traditionally used to treat white tongue due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which help to reduce the growth of bacteria and fungi on the tongue.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as aloe vera juice, sage tea, and peppermint mouthwash can be used to treat white tongue, with aloe vera helping to soothe and calm the tongue, sage tea promoting digestion and reducing inflammation, and peppermint mouthwash freshening breath and reducing bacteria.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes white tongue?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of white tongue are poor oral hygiene, dehydration, and an imbalance of good bacteria in the mouth, which can lead to the overgrowth of Candida, a fungus that coats the tongue in a white film.</p>
<p>Secondary causes may include smoking, excessive consumption of sugary foods and drinks, and certain medications that disrupt the oral microbiome, as these can further contribute to the growth of Candida.</p>
<p>A diet high in processed foods, lack of sleep, and stress can also increase the likelihood of developing white tongue, as these factors can weaken the immune system and disrupt oral health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or HIV/AIDS, may be more susceptible to white tongue due to their compromised immune systems.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal white tongue?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat white tongue are turmeric, neem, and licorice root, which have been traditionally used for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Turmeric, in particular, has therapeutic actions that include inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi, while licorice root has been shown to have antifungal properties that help reduce the growth of Candida albicans, a common cause of white tongue.</p>
<p>Neem, on the other hand, has been found to contain bioactive compounds such as nimbin and nimbidin, which have been shown to have antiseptic and antibacterial properties that can help combat oral infections.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in these herbs, including curcumin in turmeric and glycyrrhizin in licorice root, have been found to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can help soothe and heal the oral mucosa.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat white tongue?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat white tongue are various infusions and teas that help reduce inflammation and promote oral health, such as a soothing drink made with dried roots and stems, or a mouthwash prepared from the flowers of a certain plant.</p>
<p>Another preparation involves steeping the leaves of a specific herb in hot water to create a gargle that helps to kill bacteria and reduce bad breath.</p>
<p>A poultice made from the sap of a tree can be applied to the affected area to draw out toxins and promote healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, a decoction of the bark of a certain tree can be used as a mouthwash to help reduce plaque and promote a healthy oral environment.</p>
