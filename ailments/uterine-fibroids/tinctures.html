While scientific evidence is limited, some studies suggest that Vitex may help reduce symptoms associated with hormonal imbalances linked to fibroids, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. It is often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, though it should not replace medical advice or prescribed treatments.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa tincture" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains a bioactive compound called curcumin, which has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Herbal tinctures made from Curcuma longa are often used as natural remedies to support women's health, particularly in managing symptoms associated with uterine fibroids.
