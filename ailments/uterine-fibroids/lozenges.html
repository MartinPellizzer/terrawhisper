<h2 id="1">1. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus lozenge" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance, particularly in women's health.</p><p>Vitex agnus-castus herbal lozenges are formulated to help regulate menstrual cycles and may support the management of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids. These lozenges are often recommended as a natural alternative or complementary therapy for women experiencing hormonal imbalances that may contribute to fibroid growth. The herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland, which can help modulate estrogen levels and reduce the size of fibroids over time.</p><p>While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, Vitex agnus-castus lozenges may offer supportive benefits when used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="2">2. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa lozenge" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from Curcuma longa are being explored as a natural remedy for uterine fibroids due to their potential to reduce inflammation and inhibit the growth of fibroid cells. While some studies suggest curcumin may help shrink fibroids and alleviate associated symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety. These lozenges are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, offering a gentler alternative for those seeking holistic options.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using curcuma longa lozenges, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including support for liver function.</p><p>Silybum marianum herbal lozenges are formulated to provide a convenient and consistent dosage of this herb, often containing silymarin, a group of flavonoids known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to the treatment of uterine fibroids, some preliminary studies suggest it may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are factors associated with fibroid growth. These lozenges are generally considered safe for most adults when used as directed, though they should not replace conventional medical treatments for uterine fibroids without consulting a healthcare provider.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to assess individual health conditions and potential interactions before use.</p><h2 id="4">4. Cimicifuga racemosa</h2><img alt="cimicifuga racemosa lozenge" src="/images/preparations/cimicifuga-racemosa-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Cimicifuga racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms associated with menopause.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing Cimicifuga racemosa may be used as a complementary therapy for women with uterine fibroids, aiming to reduce menstrual discomfort and hormonal fluctuations. While scientific evidence on its direct impact on fibroid size is limited, some studies suggest it may help manage related symptoms such as heavy bleeding and cramping. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these lozenges, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, individual responses can vary, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments for uterine fibroids.</p><h2 id="5">5. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking licorice root to the treatment of uterine fibroids, some studies suggest that its active compounds, such as glycyrrhizin, may help reduce inflammation and hormonal imbalances that contribute to fibroid growth. Herbal lozenges made from glycyrrhiza glabra are often used to support respiratory health and soothe sore throats, but their role in managing uterine fibroids remains largely anecdotal. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using licorice-based supplements, as they can interact with certain medications and may have side effects, especially with prolonged use.</p><p>Overall, while licorice root may offer some supportive benefits, it should not be considered a primary treatment for uterine fibroids without further clinical research.</p><h2 id="6">6.

They are believed to support hormonal balance and may help reduce the size of fibroids by promoting the body's natural detoxification processes. The lozenges are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional medical treatments.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using them, as their efficacy and safety can vary among individuals.</p><h2 id="8">8. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and herbal lozenges containing ginger may offer potential benefits for women with uterine fibroids.</p><p>These lozenges are believed to help reduce inflammation and improve blood circulation, which may support the body's natural processes in managing fibroid growth. While scientific evidence is limited, some studies suggest that ginger may help alleviate symptoms such as menstrual cramps and bloating often associated with fibroids.
