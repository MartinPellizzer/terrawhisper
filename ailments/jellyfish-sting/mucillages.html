Applying herbal mucillages can reduce pain, inflammation, and irritation caused by the venom. They are often recommended as a safe and natural alternative to chemical-based treatments, especially for those with sensitive skin.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional if the sting is severe or shows signs of an allergic reaction.</p><div class="toc">
