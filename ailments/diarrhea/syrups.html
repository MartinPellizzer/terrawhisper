Indian barberry (Berberis aristata)</h2><img alt="berberis aristata syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/berberis-aristata-syrups.jpg"/><p>Berberis aristata, commonly known as the Indian barberry, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine.</p><p>Its herbal syrups are derived from the roots and stems of the plant and contain active compounds like berberine, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

However, it is important to note that there is limited clinical evidence directly linking silybum marianum to the treatment of diarrhea.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with preexisting conditions or those taking other medications.</p>
