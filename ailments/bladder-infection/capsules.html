Some studies suggest that the essential oils and flavonoids in yarrow may inhibit the growth of bacteria, including common pathogens like E. coli, which often cause urinary tract infections. However, it is important to note that while yarrow may complement conventional treatments, it should not replace medical advice or prescribed antibiotics.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow or any herbal supplement for bladder infections.</p><h2 id="6">6.

It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these capsules, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, proper dosage and quality of the product are critical to minimizing potential side effects.</p><h2 id="8">8.
