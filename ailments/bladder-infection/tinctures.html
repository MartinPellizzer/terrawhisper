These tinctures may help reduce inflammation and discomfort associated with urinary tract infections when used as a complementary therapy.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><h2 id="2">2.
