These lotions are typically applied topically to the skin, and while they may offer some calming effects, their efficacy for jaw lock—a condition often linked to tension or hormonal imbalances—requires further scientific validation. Some users report reduced jaw tension when using these products, possibly due to their calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using vitex-based lotions, especially if experiencing persistent jaw lock or other concerning symptoms.</p>
