These linctuses typically combine Vitex with other herbs like ginger or licorice root to enhance their soothing properties. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of Vitex agnus-castus specifically for hangover relief.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra linctuse" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal linctuses to alleviate symptoms of hangover due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The herb contains compounds like glycyrrhizin, which may help reduce inflammation in the digestive tract and support liver function, potentially aiding in the detoxification process after alcohol consumption.

While some studies suggest licorice may help with mild digestive discomfort, it is important to use it in moderation, as excessive consumption can lead to side effects like hypertension.</p><p>Overall, licorice-based linctuses are considered a natural remedy that may provide temporary relief from some hangover symptoms, though they should not replace proper hydration and rest.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies to alleviate symptoms associated with hangovers.</p><p>The essential oils found in cinnamon, particularly cinnamaldehyde, possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help reduce nausea and headaches often experienced after excessive alcohol consumption.

While there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking milk thistle linctuses to hangover reduction, many users report feeling a mild alleviation of symptoms such as nausea and fatigue. The soothing texture of linctuses makes them easier to consume, especially when experiencing the discomfort of a hangover.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, as individual responses and interactions with other medications can vary.</p><h2 id="10">10.
