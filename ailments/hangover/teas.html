Drinking milk thistle tea after a night of heavy drinking may aid in replenishing liver function and promoting the body's natural detoxification processes. While it is not a cure for a hangover, it can be a supportive supplement to help the body recover more efficiently.</p><p>However, it is important to note that excessive alcohol consumption should always be avoided, and herbal teas should not replace proper hydration and rest.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The mild diuretic effect of vitex may also help in flushing out toxins from the body, potentially easing some hangover symptoms.</p><p>However, it is important to note that vitex should not be seen as a substitute for hydration, rest, and proper nutrition in recovering from a hangover.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/zingiber-officinale-teas.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas to alleviate hangover symptoms.</p><p>Ginger tea helps stimulate digestion and can ease nausea, a common symptom after excessive alcohol consumption.

The menthol in peppermint may also help reduce headaches and promote a sense of clarity by improving blood flow and relaxing muscle tension. While it does not directly counteract the effects of alcohol, peppermint tea can support the body's natural detoxification process and replenish fluids lost through dehydration.</p><p>For best results, it is recommended to drink peppermint tea in moderation and pair it with plenty of water and electrolytes to aid recovery.</p><h2 id="9">9.
