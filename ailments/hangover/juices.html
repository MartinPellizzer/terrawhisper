Peppermint juice is believed to support liver function and promote hydration, both of which are crucial for recovery from a hangover. It also contains antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and detoxify the body.</p><p>While it is not a cure-all, incorporating peppermint into a hangover remedy can provide natural relief and support the body's natural recovery process.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These juices may help combat the effects of alcohol by supporting liver function and promoting detoxification processes. However, while some studies suggest turmeric may offer mild relief, it is not a substitute for adequate hydration, rest, or proper nutrition in recovering from a hangover.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before relying on herbal remedies for consistent or severe hangover symptoms.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thorn, is a lesser-known herb that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including its possible role in alleviating hangover symptoms.</p><p>This plant contains compounds that may help in reducing inflammation and supporting liver function, which are crucial in processing alcohol and mitigating the effects of a hangover.

Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/camellia-sinensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, commonly known as the plant from which green tea and black tea are derived, contains various bioactive compounds that may help alleviate hangover symptoms.</p><p>These compounds, including caffeine, antioxidants, and polyphenols, can support liver function and promote hydration, which are essential for recovery after alcohol consumption. While not a cure for a hangover, herbal juices made from Camellia sinensis may help reduce headaches, fatigue, and nausea by replenishing electrolytes and aiding in the metabolism of toxins. Some studies suggest that the antioxidants in these juices can neutralize free radicals produced during alcohol metabolism.</p><p>However, it's important to note that while Camellia sinensis may offer some relief, it should not replace adequate rest, water intake, and a balanced diet when recovering from a hangover.</p><h2 id="8">8. Rosmarinus officinalis</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosmarinus-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a versatile herb that has been traditionally used to support liver function and aid in detoxification, making it a popular ingredient in herbal juices for hangover relief.</p><p>Its essential oils, particularly cineole, help in reducing inflammation and promoting the clearance of toxins from the body, which can alleviate some of the symptoms associated with a hangover. When blended into fresh juices, rosemary adds a refreshing flavor while providing antioxidants that may help replenish nutrients depleted by alcohol consumption. Many natural health advocates recommend combining rosemary with other herbs like ginger or lemon to enhance its detoxifying properties and boost hydration.</p><p>Overall, rosemary-based herbal juices offer a natural, flavorful alternative to commercial hangover remedies, supporting the body’s recovery process through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p><h2 id="9">9.

Echinacea herbal juices are typically made by extracting the roots and leaves of the plant, which contain bioactive compounds like flavonoids and polysaccharides. These compounds may help reduce oxidative stress and boost the body's natural defenses, potentially aiding in recovery from a hangover.</p><p>However, it is important to note that echinacea should not be relied upon as a primary remedy for hangovers, and hydration, rest, and proper nutrition remain essential for recovery.</p><h2 id="10">10.
