<p>Hay fever is a common allergic condition characterized by symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, congestion, and itchy eyes, triggered by exposure to allergens like pollen, dust, and mold.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been widely used to alleviate the symptoms of hay fever due to their natural anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, and decongestant properties.</p>
<p>Examples of herbs that can be used to treat hay fever include Nettle, which has anti-inflammatory properties to reduce swelling, Quercetin, which is a natural antihistamine to alleviate itching and congestion, and Echinacea, which boosts the immune system to fight off allergens.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as Nettle tea, Quercetin capsules, Echinacea tincture, and local honey can be used to treat hay fever, with Nettle tea helping to soothe a sore throat and Quercetin capsules providing quick relief from symptoms, while Echinacea tincture can be added to water or taken sublingually for immune system support.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes hay fever?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of hay fever are an overactive immune system's reaction to specific allergens such as pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds, which triggers the release of histamine, leading to symptoms like congestion and itching.</p>
<p>Secondary causes can include exposure to mold, dust mites, and pet dander, as well as strong scents and chemicals, which can exacerbate existing allergies.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing hay fever include living in urban or rural areas with high pollen counts, working outdoors, or having a family history of allergies, as these factors can heighten sensitivity to allergens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, individuals who engage in regular outdoor activities or have pets in the home may also be more susceptible to hay fever due to increased exposure to potential allergens.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal hay fever?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat hay fever are Nettle (Urtica dioica), Butterbur (Petasites hybridus), and Quercetin-rich herbs like Elderflower (Sambucus nigra).</p>
<p>These herbs exhibit anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties, helping to alleviate symptoms such as congestion and itching.</p>
<p>Nettle is rich in flavonoids, saponins, and polyphenols, including beta-sitosterol and scopoletin, which contribute to its therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Butterbur, on the other hand, contains sesquiterpenes like petasins and isopetasin, which have potent anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat hay fever?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat hay fever are a blend of teas, infusions, tinctures, and syrups that help alleviate symptoms such as congestion and itching.</p>
<p>Infusions made with flowers and leaves are often used to reduce inflammation and promote drainage, while teas with roots and barks are used to calm the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Tinctures and syrups made from these plant parts are also used to soothe a sore throat and reduce mucus production.</p>
<p>Additionally, decoctions and infusions are used to create a warm compress to apply to the face and neck to relieve itching and discomfort.</p>
