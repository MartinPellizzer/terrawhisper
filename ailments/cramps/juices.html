Some studies suggest that nettle may help reduce uterine contractions and promote relaxation of the muscles, offering natural relief for menstrual pain.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using nettle juice, especially for those with existing health conditions or who are taking medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to alleviate symptoms of cramps and menstrual discomfort.</p><p>The fruit of the Rosa canina plant, often consumed as a juice or syrup, contains high levels of vitamin C, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds that can help reduce muscle spasms and pain.

Rosa canina juice is typically prepared by blending the ripe berries with water or other herbal ingredients, creating a soothing and nourishing beverage.</p><p>When used regularly, it may support overall digestive health and provide gentle relief from cramping without the use of synthetic medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and alleviate menstrual cramps.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, it may help reduce the severity of cramps by regulating progesterone levels, which can ease uterine contractions. The juice is often recommended for women experiencing irregular periods or premenstrual symptoms. It is typically prepared by soaking the dried berries in water or juice for several hours before consumption.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using chasteberry juice, especially during pregnancy or if taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy often used to support liver health and may also offer relief for menstrual cramps due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Some studies suggest that the active compound silymarin in milk thistle can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which may alleviate the discomfort associated with cramps. When consumed as a juice, silybum marianum can be easily integrated into a daily wellness routine, though it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or on medications. The juice is typically made by combining the leaves and seeds of the plant with water or other herbal ingredients, enhancing its bioavailability and effectiveness.</p><p>While it may provide natural relief for cramps, it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment for severe or persistent menstrual pain.</p><h2 id="8">8. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/matricaria-chamomilla-juices.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a popular herbal remedy used to alleviate menstrual cramps due to its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Chamomile herbal juice, derived from the flowering part of the plant, contains compounds like apigenin that help relax muscle tissues and reduce pain. It is often consumed as a tea or diluted juice to ease cramping and promote overall digestive comfort. The soothing effects of chamomile can also help reduce stress, which is a common contributor to menstrual discomfort.</p><p>While generally safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using chamomile, especially for those with allergies or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cinnamomum-verum-juices.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential to alleviate menstrual cramps due to its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>The essential oils and compounds found in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, may help reduce uterine contractions and ease pain associated with cramps. When consumed as a herbal juice, cinnamon can be blended with other soothing ingredients like ginger or turmeric to enhance its effectiveness. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon juice, especially for prolonged periods or in high concentrations, to avoid potential side effects.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, scientific research on its efficacy for cramps is still limited, so it should be used as a complementary rather than a primary treatment.</p><h2 id="10">10. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as St. Benedict's thistle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in alleviating cramps.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids, which may help reduce inflammation and muscle spasms.
