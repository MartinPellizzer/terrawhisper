To prepare a herbal decoction, the selected herbs are steeped in hot water for several hours, creating a concentrated liquid that can be applied topically to affected nails. Some studies suggest that regular use of these decoctions may help reduce symptoms and prevent the spread of infection, though results can vary.</p><p>While herbal treatments may complement conventional therapies, they should not replace professional medical advice, especially for severe or persistent cases of nail fungus.</p><div class="toc">

Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum decoction" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, has been traditionally used for its potential antifungal properties, making it a subject of interest in the treatment of nail fungus.</p><p>Herbal decoctions of Hypericum perforatum are prepared by simmering the dried plant material in water, allowing the active compounds such as hypericin and hyperforin to be extracted. Some studies suggest that these compounds may inhibit the growth of fungal organisms, including those responsible for onychomycosis. However, while preliminary research is promising, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for treating nail fungus.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if other medications are being taken.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These decoctions may help inhibit the growth of fungal organisms by disrupting their cell membranes and reducing inflammation around the affected nail. While some preliminary studies suggest sage's antifungal properties, more clinical research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for nail fungus.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using sage decoctions as part of a treatment plan.</p><h2 id="5">5.
