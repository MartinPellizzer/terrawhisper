Many people prefer herbal tinctures because they are less harsh than prescription antifungal medications and may offer a more holistic approach to treatment. However, their effectiveness can vary, and it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially if the infection is severe or persistent.</p><p>While some users report improvement in nail appearance and reduced fungal growth, scientific evidence supporting their efficacy remains limited.</p><div class="toc">
