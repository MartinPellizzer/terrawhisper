<h2 id="1">1. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, and some proponents suggest that its herbal juices may help in treating nail fungus due to its antifungal and anti-inflammatory compounds.</p><p>The juice extracted from fresh stinging nettle leaves contains compounds like silica, which can strengthen nails and improve their overall health. While there is limited scientific research on its effectiveness specifically for nail fungus, some natural remedies advocate for its use as a complementary treatment. To prepare the juice, fresh nettle leaves are typically washed, blended, and strained to remove the irritating hairs.</p><p>It is important to note that individuals should consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially if they have sensitive skin or existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Teucrium polium</h2><img alt="teucrium polium juice" src="/images/preparations/teucrium-polium-juices.jpg"/><p>Teucrium polium, also known as summer savory, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that extracts from this plant may help in the treatment of nail fungus due to their ability to inhibit the growth of fungi such as Candida and Trichophyton. When prepared as a herbal juice, Teucrium polium can be applied topically to affected nails, potentially reducing fungal infections and promoting nail health. The juice is typically made by steeping the leaves in a carrier oil or water, allowing the active compounds to be absorbed into the skin.</p><p>While more research is needed, some users have reported improvement in nail fungus symptoms after regular use of Teucrium polium herbal juice.</p><h2 id="3">3. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia juice" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-juices.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, making it a promising ingredient in herbal juices for treating nail fungus.</p><p>The essential oils extracted from lavender contain compounds like linalool and lavender alcohol, which have shown effectiveness against various fungal infections, including those affecting nails. When incorporated into herbal juices, lavender can support the body's natural defenses against fungal growth, promoting healthier nail development. These juices are often combined with other antifungal herbs such as tea tree oil or garlic to enhance their efficacy.</p><p>While lavender-based herbal juices may offer a natural alternative to conventional treatments, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe nail fungus cases.</p><h2 id="4">4. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum juice" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-juices.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, contains essential oils and phytochemicals that have shown antimicrobial properties, making it a potential natural remedy for nail fungus.</p><p>When used in the form of herbal juices, cinnamon can help inhibit the growth of fungi by disrupting their cell membranes and reducing inflammation. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, may provide a safe and effective alternative to conventional antifungal treatments. To use cinnamon juice for nail fungus, it is typically diluted with water or a carrier oil to prevent skin irritation.</p><p>While it may offer some relief, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe fungal infections.</p><h2 id="5">5. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum juice" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-juices.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, has been traditionally used for its potential antifungal properties, making it a subject of interest in natural remedies for nail fungus.</p><p>While research on its effectiveness specifically for fungal infections of the nails is limited, some studies suggest that its active compounds, such as hypericin and hyperforin, may inhibit the growth of certain fungi. Herbal juices made from Hypericum perforatum are sometimes used topically to apply directly to affected nails, aiming to reduce inflammation and promote healing. However, it is important to note that these juices should not replace conventional antifungal treatments without consulting a healthcare professional.</p><p>Due to the lack of extensive clinical trials, the efficacy and safety of using Hypericum perforatum herbal juices for nail fungus remain areas requiring further scientific investigation.</p><h2 id="6">6. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting liver function.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for nail fungus, some studies suggest that its active compound, silymarin, may have antifungal properties that could help in managing fungal infections. Herbal juices made from silybum marianum are often consumed internally to promote overall detoxification and immune support, which may indirectly aid in fighting off fungal infections. However, it is important to note that these juices should not replace conventional antifungal treatments prescribed by a healthcare professional.</p><p>Always consult with a medical expert before using herbal remedies for nail fungus to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><h2 id="7">7. Teucrium marum</h2><img alt="teucrium marum juice" src="/images/preparations/teucrium-marum-juices.jpg"/><p>Teucrium marum, also known as horseweed, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential antifungal properties.</p><p>Some preliminary studies suggest that extracts from this plant may inhibit the growth of fungi, making it a possible natural remedy for nail fungus.

However, more scientific research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for treating nail fungus specifically.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using Teucrium marum for nail fungal infections.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea juice" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-juices.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a herbal plant often used for its immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While it is traditionally used to support the immune system and reduce the duration of colds, some people explore its potential benefits for nail fungus due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Herbal juices made from echinacea may contain compounds that could inhibit the growth of fungi, although scientific evidence specifically supporting its efficacy against nail fungus is limited. Some natural health practitioners recommend echinacea as a complementary treatment alongside conventional antifungal therapies.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea or any herbal remedy for nail fungus, as individual responses and potential interactions can vary.</p><h2 id="9">9.

Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, making it a potential natural remedy for nail fungus.</p><p>Herbal juices extracted from sage leaves contain compounds like thujone and rosmarinic acid, which may inhibit the growth of fungal organisms.
