<p>Herbal mucillages for Hypertension are a type of natural remedy that involves the use of mucilaginous herbs to treat high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Mucilaginous herbs, also known as demulcents, have a soothing effect on the mucous membranes and can help to reduce inflammation and stress on the cardiovascular system, thereby lowering blood pressure.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal mucillages that can be used to treat hypertension include licorice root, which has been shown to lower blood pressure by reducing the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that can contribute to high blood pressure; slippery elm, which can help to soothe and calm the cardiovascular system; and marshmallow root, which has anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce inflammation in the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbs such as dandelion root, ginger, and turmeric have been traditionally used to help lower blood pressure due to their ability to reduce inflammation and improve cardiovascular health.</p>
