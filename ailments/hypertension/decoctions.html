<p>Herbal decoctions for hypertension are a type of traditional remedy that involves infusing herbs in hot water to create a tea-like solution, which is used to treat high blood pressure.</p>
<p>These decoctions have been found to be beneficial in treating hypertension due to their ability to relax blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and prevent the formation of blood clots.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal decoctions used to treat hypertension include hawthorn, which helps to strengthen heart muscles and improve blood flow; garlic, which has a natural ability to lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation; ginger, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help to prevent blood clotting; and passionflower, which acts as a natural sedative to reduce stress and anxiety that can contribute to high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal decoctions such as olive leaf, dandelion root, and yarrow have also been found to be effective in treating hypertension due to their ability to improve cardiovascular health and reduce blood pressure.</p>
