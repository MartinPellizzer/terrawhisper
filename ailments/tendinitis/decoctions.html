Herbal decoctions made from Curcuma longa are often prepared by simmering the rhizome in water to extract its bioactive components, making it a popular natural remedy in traditional medicine. Some clinical studies suggest that curcumin supplementation can improve symptoms of tendinitis, although more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and optimal dosage.</p><p>Despite its promise, curcumin's poor bioavailability remains a challenge, and combining it with black pepper or fats may enhance its absorption for better therapeutic outcomes.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Some studies suggest that the essential oils and flavonoids present in yarrow contribute to its therapeutic effects on musculoskeletal conditions. However, while anecdotal evidence supports its use, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for treating tendinitis.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow decoctions as a complementary therapy.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Herbal decoctions made from vitex agnus-castus are typically prepared by simmering the dried berries in water for several hours, allowing the active constituents to be extracted. These decoctions may support joint health and aid in the recovery process by promoting circulation and reducing oxidative stress.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex agnus-castus, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7.
