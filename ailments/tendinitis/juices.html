<h2 id="1">1. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains a bioactive compound called curcumin, which is renowned for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>These properties make turmeric a popular herbal remedy for conditions like tendinitis, where inflammation and pain are prevalent. When consumed as a juice, curcumin is more bioavailable, allowing the body to absorb and utilize its therapeutic benefits more effectively. Turmeric juice can be combined with other ingredients like ginger or black pepper to enhance its absorption and efficacy.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using turmeric juice as a treatment for tendinitis to ensure it is safe and appropriate for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular choice for herbal juices aimed at alleviating tendinitis.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as flavonoids, antioxidants, and minerals like silica, which may help reduce inflammation and support tissue repair in affected tendons. When prepared as a juice, urtica dioica can be consumed internally to promote overall joint and tendon health. However, it is important to note that while some individuals report relief from tendinitis symptoms, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy is limited, and it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating urtica dioica juice into a treatment regimen for tendinitis.</p><h2 id="3">3. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it a popular choice in herbal remedies for conditions like tendinitis.</p><p>The fruit of the Rosa canina plant, when processed into juice, contains high levels of vitamin C, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds that may help reduce inflammation and support tissue repair. Some studies suggest that the antioxidants in Rosa canina juice can help alleviate pain and improve joint mobility in individuals with tendinitis. However, while it is generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment, especially if you are on medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><p>Overall, Rosa canina herbal juice may serve as a complementary therapy for managing symptoms of tendinitis, though more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy.</p><h2 id="4">4. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may be beneficial for conditions like tendinitis.</p><p>The active compound, silymarin, is believed to support liver function and reduce oxidative stress, which can contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. Some preliminary research suggests that silybum marianum may help alleviate symptoms of tendinitis by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair. However, more clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for this specific condition.</p><p>When considering herbal juices containing silybum marianum, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to ensure they are appropriate for individual health needs.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Some preliminary studies suggest that sage extracts could help alleviate pain and improve joint mobility in individuals with tendon inflammation. However, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for treating tendinitis.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using sage-based remedies as part of a treatment plan for tendinitis.</p><h2 id="6">6. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/hypericum-perforatum-juices.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild depression, recent studies suggest that its active compounds, such as hypericin and hyperforin, may also help reduce inflammation associated with tendinitis. Herbal juices made from Hypericum perforatum are believed to support tissue repair and alleviate pain by modulating inflammatory responses in the body. However, it is important to note that St. John's wort can interact with various medications, so consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended before use.</p><p>Despite its natural appeal, hypericum perforatum herbal juices should not replace conventional medical treatments for tendinitis without professional guidance.</p><h2 id="7">7. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular choice in herbal remedies for conditions like tendinitis.</p><p>Ginger contains bioactive compounds such as gingerol and shogaol, which help reduce inflammation and pain by inhibiting inflammatory pathways in the body.

Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/achillea-millefolium-juices.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it may help reduce inflammation and pain associated with tendinitis by promoting blood circulation and reducing oxidative stress in the affected tissues. The active compounds in yarrow, such as flavonoids and essential oils, contribute to its potential therapeutic effects on inflammatory conditions. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using yarrow juice, as it may interact with certain medications or cause adverse effects in some individuals.</p><p>While anecdotal evidence suggests benefit, scientific research on its efficacy for tendinitis remains limited, emphasizing the need for further study.</p><h2 id="9">9. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/equisetum-arvense-juices.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a traditional herb that has been used for its high silica content, which is believed to support connective tissue health.</p><p>Herbal juices made from Equisetum arvense are often recommended for individuals suffering from tendinitis due to their potential anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties.
