<p>Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by an overproduction of thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, weight loss, and nervousness.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat hyperthyroidism, offering a natural and potentially safer alternative to conventional medications.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like Bladderwrack, Irish Moss, and Kelp have been found to help regulate thyroid function due to their rich iodine content, while others like Ashwagandha, Holy Basil, and Licorice root have anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic properties that can help alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as teas, infusions, and tinctures made from herbs like Burdock, Dandelion, and Milk Thistle can also be effective in treating hyperthyroidism by supporting liver function, reducing inflammation, and promoting detoxification.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes hyperthyroidism?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of hyperthyroidism are usually autoimmune disorders, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, as seen in Graves' disease, or iodine imbalance, which can lead to an overproduction of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of hyperthyroidism may include thyroid nodules or goiters, which can become overactive and produce excess hormones, as well as excessive intake of iodine, which can stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones.</p>
<p>Certain lifestyles, such as consuming a high-sugar diet and being physically inactive, may also contribute to the development of hyperthyroidism by increasing inflammation and insulin resistance, which can stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones.</p>
<p>Additionally, stress and sleep deprivation can also increase the risk of developing hyperthyroidism by disrupting the body's natural hormonal balance.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal hyperthyroidism?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat hyperthyroidism are Ashwagandha, which exhibits therapeutic actions such as reducing cortisol levels and oxidative stress, thereby mitigating thyroid hormone production, and contains bioactive compounds like withanolides that inhibit the activity of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>Licorice root, rich in glycyrrhizin, has anti-inflammatory properties that help alleviate symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, such as anxiety and fatigue.</p>
<p>Bladderwrack, a seaweed rich in iodine, can help regulate thyroid hormone production and contains bioactive compounds like fucoidan that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Schisandra, with its bioactive compounds like schisandrins, has been traditionally used to support adrenal function and balance thyroid hormone levels, making it a valuable herb in treating hyperthyroidism.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat hyperthyroidism?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat hyperthyroidism are often made from plants with adaptogenic properties that help regulate the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Teas and infusions made from certain roots and leaves can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and weight loss.</p>
<p>Decoctions of specific underground plant parts can also help lower thyroid hormone production and promote overall hormone balance.</p>
<p>Additionally, tonics made from specific flowers and seeds can aid in calming the nervous system and reducing anxiety associated with hyperthyroidism.</p>
