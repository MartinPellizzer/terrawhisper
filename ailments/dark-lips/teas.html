Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tea" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-teas.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hormonal balancing properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it may support the regulation of estrogen levels, which can influence the pigmentation and health of the lips. Some users report that regular consumption of vitex herbal tea may lead to a reduction in dark lip discoloration over time. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant.</p><p>While not a guaranteed solution, vitex agnus-castus tea is often considered a natural remedy for those seeking to improve the appearance of their lips through holistic means.</p><h2 id="7">7.
