<h2 id="1">1. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla linctuse" src="/images/preparations/matricaria-chamomilla-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a gentle herbal remedy often used in the form of linctus to alleviate breast pain experienced by breastfeeding mothers.</p><p>The linctus is typically prepared with a mild herbal infusion that can be applied directly to the breasts or taken orally to reduce inflammation and soothe discomfort. Chamomile is valued for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties, which may help ease engorgement, mastitis, or nipple soreness. It is generally considered safe for use during breastfeeding, though it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before starting any herbal treatment.</p><p>Regular application of chamomile linctus can provide natural relief and support the comfort of nursing mothers.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica linctuse" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal linctuses to alleviate breast pain associated with breastfeeding.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated extract of stinging nettle leaves, which are rich in anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds. When applied topically to the affected breast area, the linctus may help reduce inflammation, soothe irritation, and ease discomfort caused by engorgement or mastitis. It is important for breastfeeding mothers to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedies to ensure safety for both mother and infant.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and long-term effects of nettle-based linctuses during lactation.</p><h2 id="3">3.

When applied topically as a linctus, fennel can help ease discomfort associated with mastitis or engorgement without the need for systemic medications. It is important to use a diluted form of the essential oil to avoid skin irritation, especially for nursing mothers.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use to ensure safety and appropriateness for both mother and baby.</p><h2 id="4">4. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea linctuse" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and immunostimulant properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal linctuses, it may provide soothing relief for breastfeeding-related breast pain by reducing inflammation and supporting immune function. Some studies suggest that echinacea may help alleviate symptoms of mastitis, a common condition causing breast pain during breastfeeding. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using echinacea, as its safety during lactation is not fully established.</p><p>Despite its popularity, individual responses to herbal treatments can vary, and it should not replace professional medical advice or prescribed treatments.</p><h2 id="5">5. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support liver function and may offer benefits for breastfeeding women experiencing breast pain.</p><p>While there is limited direct research on its effectiveness for breast pain specifically, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help reduce inflammation and discomfort in the mammary glands. When used as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it is typically taken orally and may be considered a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for mastitis or engorgement. However, breastfeeding mothers should consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal supplements to ensure safety for both mother and infant.</p><p>Due to the lack of extensive clinical trials, the use of silybum marianum during breastfeeding remains a topic of cautious consideration.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, is often used in herbal linctuses to alleviate breast pain associated with breastfeeding.</p><p>This herb is believed to support hormonal balance by influencing prolactin and dopamine levels, which can help reduce discomfort and inflammation in the breasts. Herbal linctuses containing vitex agnus-castus are typically used as a natural alternative to conventional pain relievers, offering a gentle and non-invasive option for nursing mothers. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedy, especially while breastfeeding, to ensure safety and appropriateness for both mother and baby.</p><p>Overall, vitex agnus-castus may provide relief for breast pain, but its effectiveness can vary, and it should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to breastfeeding comfort.</p><h2 id="7">7. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale linctuse" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used to alleviate various ailments, including breast pain experienced by breastfeeding mothers.</p><p>Ginger contains bioactive compounds such as gingerols and shogaols, which possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that may help reduce discomfort. When used in the form of herbal linctuses, ginger can be administered in a soothing, easily absorbable manner, making it a convenient option for nursing women. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedy to ensure safety for both mother and infant.</p><p>While some studies suggest ginger may offer relief, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and optimal dosing for lactating individuals.</p><h2 id="8">8. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina linctuse" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina herbal linctus, derived from the hips of the rose plant, is often used to alleviate breast pain experienced by breastfeeding mothers.</p><p>This natural remedy is believed to help reduce inflammation and promote the healing of cracked or sore nipples. It works by soothing the affected area and supporting the body's natural healing processes. Many lactating women find it beneficial as a safe, non-pharmacological option during breastfeeding.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedy to ensure it is appropriate for individual health needs.</p><h2 id="9">9. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia linctuse" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal linctuses to alleviate breast pain experienced by breastfeeding mothers.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a soothing blend of lavender essential oil and other natural ingredients that help reduce inflammation and discomfort. The calming properties of lavender may also promote relaxation, which can aid in managing the stress associated with breastfeeding. When applied topically, the linctus can provide localized relief by easing engorgement, mastitis, or sore nipples.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedies to ensure safety for both the mother and the nursing infant.</p><h2 id="10">10. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and it may offer relief for breastfeeding mothers experiencing breast pain.</p><p>When used in the form of a linctus, or herbal syrup, it can help soothe inflammation and reduce discomfort associated with engorgement or mastitis. However, it is important to note that St. John's Wort can interact with various medications, including those used during breastfeeding, so its use should be discussed with a healthcare provider. While some studies suggest it may be safe in small doses, caution is advised due to potential effects on milk supply and infant exposure.</p><p>Breastfeeding mothers should always consult with a licensed healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy to ensure safety for both mother and baby.</p>
