Many nursing mothers find relief by drinking fennel tea, as it is believed to support milk flow and ease engorgement. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using fennel, especially to ensure it is safe for both the mother and the baby.</p><p>While fennel tea is generally considered safe in moderate amounts, excessive consumption may lead to side effects such as gastrointestinal upset or allergic reactions.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/silybum-marianum-teas.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support liver function and may offer benefits for breastfeeding women experiencing breast pain.</p><p>Some studies suggest that the active compound silymarin in milk thistle may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could help reduce breast tenderness and inflammation. However, it is important for breastfeeding mothers to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal supplements, as the safety and efficacy during lactation are not fully established. While some women report relief from breast pain with milk thistle tea, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in this context.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it should be used cautiously and in conjunction with medical advice to ensure the health of both mother and baby.</p><h2 id="8">8.

Black elderberry (Sambucus nigra)</h2><img alt="sambucus nigra tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/sambucus-nigra-teas.jpg"/><p>Sambucus nigra, commonly known as European elderberry, is often used in herbal teas to support immune health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for breast pain during breastfeeding, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory properties may help alleviate discomfort associated with mastitis or engorgement. Herbal teas made from elderberries are typically consumed as a warm infusion, which can promote relaxation and ease the body’s response to inflammation. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using elderberry tea, especially while breastfeeding, to ensure it is safe for both mother and baby.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses can vary, and it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment for persistent breast pain.</p><h2 id="10">10.
