The tincture is typically made by soaking the dried leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds to be extracted for use. Breastfeeding mothers considering this herbal remedy should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure it is safe and appropriate for their specific situation.</p><p>While some studies suggest that nettle may support lactation and reduce breast pain, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety during breastfeeding.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important for breastfeeding mothers to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal tinctures to ensure safety for both the mother and the baby.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and long-term effects during lactation.</p><h2 id="3">3.
