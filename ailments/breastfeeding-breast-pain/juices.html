However, it is important to note that while some studies suggest potential benefits, there is limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for breast pain during lactation. Breastfeeding mothers should consult with a healthcare provider before using chamomile or any herbal remedy to ensure safety for both mother and baby.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, caution is advised due to the potential for allergic reactions or interactions with other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle juice, as it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for all individuals. While some studies suggest its potential benefits, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety specifically for breastfeeding women.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to use it in moderation and monitor for any adverse reactions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rose hip, is a popular herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support joint health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When consumed as a juice, it provides a rich source of vitamins, particularly vitamin C, which can help boost the immune system and promote overall wellness. For breastfeeding mothers experiencing breast pain, rosa canina juice may offer natural relief by reducing inflammation and supporting milk production. Its gentle nature makes it a safe option for many women during the postpartum period.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating any new herbal supplements into a breastfeeding regimen.</p><h2 id="4">4. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support liver health and may offer benefits for breastfeeding mothers experiencing breast pain.</p><p>The active compound in milk thistle, silymarin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could help reduce breast tenderness and inflammation. Some studies suggest that silymarin may support the healing of mammary tissue, potentially alleviating discomfort associated with mastitis or engorgement. However, it is important for breastfeeding mothers to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal supplements, as their safety and efficacy during lactation are still being researched.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, milk thistle should not be considered a substitute for medical treatment, and it is best used as a complementary approach under professional guidance.</p><h2 id="5">5.

When consumed as a herbal juice, fennel can support lactation and reduce inflammation in the breasts. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using fennel, especially during breastfeeding, to ensure safety for both mother and infant.</p><p>While some women find relief from breast pain with fennel juice, individual responses may vary, and it should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to breastfeeding support.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may help alleviate breast pain in breastfeeding women.</p><p>The herb is believed to influence prolactin levels, which can reduce engorgement and discomfort associated with lactation. Herbal juices made from vitex are often consumed as a natural remedy to ease symptoms and promote milk flow. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, as it may interact with certain medications or affect hormone-sensitive conditions.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety during breastfeeding.</p><h2 id="7">7. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While some studies suggest it may help reduce breast pain during breastfeeding, it is important to note that it can interact with certain medications and affect milk supply. Due to its impact on hormone levels, nursing mothers should consult a healthcare provider before using Cnicus benedictus herbal juices. Additionally, there is limited clinical evidence specifically supporting its efficacy for breast pain in lactating women.</p><p>As a result, it is often recommended as a complementary rather than primary treatment for this condition.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cuminum cyminum</h2><img alt="cuminum cyminum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cuminum-cyminum-juices.jpg"/><p>Cuminum cyminum, commonly known as cumin, is a herb that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.</p><p>Some breastfeeding mothers may consider cumin herbal juices as a natural remedy for breast pain, such as mastitis or engorgement, due to its purported ability to improve milk flow and reduce inflammation. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of cumin juice specifically for breast pain during lactation. While some women report relief after consuming cumin-based herbal teas or juices, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedy while breastfeeding to ensure safety for both mother and baby.</p><p>Always prioritize evidence-based treatments and maintain open communication with a lactation consultant or physician when dealing with breast-related issues.</p><h2 id="9">9. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/lavandula-angustifolia-juices.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, has been traditionally used for its calming and healing properties.</p><p>When used in herbal juices, it may help alleviate breast pain in breastfeeding women by reducing inflammation and promoting relaxation. The essential oils in lavender are believed to have antiseptic and analgesic effects, which can ease discomfort caused by mastitis or engorgement. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using lavender juices, as they may interact with medications or affect milk supply.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for nursing mothers.</p><h2 id="10">10. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been widely recognized for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular herbal remedy for various health issues.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, turmeric can help alleviate breast pain experienced by breastfeeding mothers, particularly during engorgement or mastitis. The active compound curcumin in turmeric works by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which are often contributing factors to breast discomfort. To prepare turmeric juice, fresh turmeric root is typically grated and mixed with water or a mild milk alternative, enhancing its bioavailability and palatability.</p><p>However, it is important for nursing mothers to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating turmeric into their diet to ensure safety and appropriateness for both mother and baby.</p>
