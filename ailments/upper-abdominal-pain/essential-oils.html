Peppermint oil, in particular, is known for its ability to relax the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, making it effective for cramping and bloating.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially for chronic or severe abdominal pain, to ensure they are appropriate for individual health conditions.</p>
