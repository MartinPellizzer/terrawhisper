It contains compounds such as glycyrrhizin, which may have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties that contribute to its therapeutic effects. However, excessive consumption of licorice root tea can lead to side effects like increased blood pressure due to its effect on the adrenal glands.</p><p>As a result, it is often recommended to use licorice root tea in moderation and consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a treatment regimen for upper abdominal pain.</p><h2 id="5">5.
