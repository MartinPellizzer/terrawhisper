These herbal creams are often formulated with other natural ingredients like honey, eucalyptus, or menthol to enhance their soothing effects. They are particularly beneficial for individuals suffering from conditions such as laryngitis, coughs, or seasonal allergies that cause throat discomfort.</p><p>However, long-term use of licorice-based products should be monitored due to potential side effects associated with high levels of glycyrrhizin.</p><h2 id="2">2.
