While some users report increased sexual desire and arousal, more scientific research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for long-term use.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into a wellness routine.</p><h2 id="4">4. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/vitex-agnus-castus-creams.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is often used in herbal creams to support hormonal balance in women, which may help with issues related to loss of female libido.</p><p>These creams typically contain concentrated extracts of the herb, which are believed to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and regulate estrogen and progesterone levels. While some studies suggest that vitex may improve mood and hormonal fluctuations, its direct impact on libido remains inconclusive and requires more clinical research. Herbal creams containing vitex are often marketed as natural alternatives to conventional treatments, appealing to those seeking holistic approaches.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using these products, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><h2 id="5">5.

It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using such products, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>Overall, while ginkgo biloba herbal creams may offer potential benefits, they should be used as part of a holistic approach to sexual health rather than a standalone solution.</p><h2 id="7">7.
