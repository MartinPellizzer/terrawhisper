<h2 id="1">1. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum cream" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-creams.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is often used for mood disorders, some people have explored its potential in treating pink eye due to these properties. However, there is limited scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of St. John's Wort creams for conjunctivitis, and its use for this condition is not widely recommended by ophthalmologists. The herb can interact with various medications, including antibiotics and anticoagulants, which may pose risks when used without medical supervision.</p><p>Therefore, it is generally advised to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies for pink eye.</p><h2 id="2">2. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is often used in herbal creams for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which may offer some relief for symptoms of pink eye.</p><p>These creams typically contain calendula extract, which is believed to soothe irritated eyes and reduce redness and swelling. While calendula is generally safe for topical use, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it for pink eye, especially if there is an underlying infection or allergy. Some studies suggest that calendula may help promote healing of the conjunctiva, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>As a natural remedy, calendula-based creams can be a gentle option for mild cases of pink eye, but they should not replace medical treatment in severe or persistent cases.</p><h2 id="3">3.

While there is limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for eye conditions, some studies suggest that chamomile may have antimicrobial and antioxidant benefits that could aid in healing. Herbal creams containing chamomilla recutita are typically applied externally around the eyes, and they are often used as a complementary treatment alongside conventional medical care.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy for pink eye, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="4">4. Euphrasia officinalis</h2><img alt="euphrasia officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/euphrasia-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Euphrasia officinalis, commonly known as eyebright, is a traditional herbal remedy often used in the formulation of herbal creams for treating pink eye.</p><p>These creams typically contain extracts of Euphrasia officinalis, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and astringent properties that may help soothe irritated eyes. While not a substitute for medical treatment, some people use these creams as a complementary therapy to alleviate symptoms such as redness, itching, and discharge. The use of Euphrasia officinalis in herbal creams is rooted in historical herbal medicine practices and is supported by some anecdotal evidence of its efficacy.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially for an eye condition like pink eye.</p><h2 id="5">5. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica cream" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-creams.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p><p>Some herbal creams containing Urtica dioica are marketed for their potential to alleviate symptoms of pink eye, such as redness and irritation.

Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis cream" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-creams.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal creams for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help alleviate symptoms of pink eye.</p><p>These creams can provide a cooling effect on the eyes, reducing redness and irritation associated with the condition. While aloe vera is generally safe for topical use, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before applying it to the eyes, especially if there is an underlying infection.
