Tinctures made from fresh or dried Urtica dioica leaves are typically diluted in alcohol or glycerin and applied topically around the eyes, though direct application to the affected area should be avoided. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially for conditions like pink eye, which can be contagious.</p><p>As with any treatment, the effectiveness of Urtica dioica tinctures for pink eye may vary, and they should not replace conventional medical care.</p><h2 id="6">6.

It is important to note that Vitex agnus-castus tinctures should not replace conventional medical treatments for pink eye, and individuals should consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially if they have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, the effectiveness and safety of Vitex agnus-castus tinctures can vary, and more research is needed to fully understand its role in eye health.</p><h2 id="7">7.
