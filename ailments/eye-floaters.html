<p>Eye floaters is a common condition where small, dark spots or threads appear to float in front of the eyes, often caused by the aging process, injury, or certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat eye floaters, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Herbs such as bilberry, ginkgo biloba, and chamomile have been found to be particularly effective in reducing the visibility of eye floaters due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye washes made from calendula, eyebright, and goldenseal can help to reduce inflammation and promote healing, while supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin A can help to nourish and protect the eyes.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes eye floaters?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of eye floaters are age-related changes in the vitreous gel that fills the eye, and injury to the eye that causes blood or other debris to form in the vitreous.</p>
<p>Secondary causes can include diabetes, which can cause blood vessel damage and lead to the formation of floaters, as well as nearsightedness and cataracts, which can cause the vitreous to become more liquid and lead to floater formation.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing eye floaters include smoking, which can cause damage to the blood vessels and lead to the formation of debris in the vitreous, and prolonged periods of near vision, such as those experienced by computer users or readers, which can cause strain on the eyes and lead to changes in the vitreous.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who have a family history of eye floaters or have experienced eye injuries or surgeries are also at increased risk.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal eye floaters?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat eye floaters are bilberry, ginkgo biloba, and eyebright, which have been traditionally used to promote eye health and alleviate the symptoms of this condition.</p>
<p>Bilberry and ginkgo biloba have therapeutic actions such as improving blood flow to the eyes and reducing inflammation, while eyebright has been used to treat conjunctivitis and promote healing of the eye tissues.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in these herbs include anthocyanins in bilberry, which have antioxidant properties that can help reduce oxidative stress, and flavonoids in ginkgo biloba, which have anti-inflammatory effects that can help reduce swelling in the eyes.</p>
<p>Additionally, eyebright contains saponins, which have antimicrobial properties that can help combat eye infections and promote a healthy environment for the eyes.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat eye floaters?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat eye floaters are made into teas, infusions, and decoctions that help to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the eyes.</p>
<p>Consuming these preparations in the form of a warm tea or infusion can help to nourish the eye tissues and promote the removal of debris and waste products that can cause floaters.</p>
<p>Certain herbal preparations can also be applied topically as eye drops or compresses to directly address the issue, reducing the appearance of floaters and improving vision clarity.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of these herbal preparations, such as a daily cup of tea or infusion, can also help to prevent the formation of new floaters and promote overall eye health.</p>
