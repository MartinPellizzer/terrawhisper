The natural compounds in salvia officinalis, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to soothe and protect gum tissue. When applied topically, these creams can provide relief from the discomfort associated with swollen gums, often caused by periodontal disease or gingivitis.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a dentist or healthcare professional before using such products, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The natural compounds in aloe vera, such as polysaccharides and enzymes, may help decrease inflammation and prevent bacterial growth that contributes to gum irritation. When applied topically, aloe-based creams can provide a cooling effect, offering relief from the discomfort associated with swollen gums.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a dentist or healthcare professional before using such products, especially if the swelling is due to an underlying condition like periodontitis.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, are believed to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, thereby promoting gum healing. When applied topically, these herbal creams can provide a soothing effect and may support overall oral health when used as part of a regular dental hygiene routine.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a dentist before using such products, especially if the gum swelling is severe or persistent.</p><h2 id="4">4.

These creams are often formulated with other natural ingredients like calendula or chamomile to enhance their therapeutic effects. However, due to the plant's toxic alkaloids, it is crucial to use such products under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p><p>While some users report relief from gum irritation, more scientific research is needed to fully establish its safety and efficacy for this specific application.</p><h2 id="5">5. Eucalyptus globulus</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus cream" src="/images/preparations/eucalyptus-globulus-creams.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus oil, is often incorporated into herbal creams for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These creams are designed to alleviate gum swelling by reducing inflammation and preventing bacterial infections that contribute to periodontal issues. The essential oil derived from eucalyptus globulus contains compounds like cineole, which have been shown to support oral health. When applied topically, these creams can provide a soothing effect and promote healing of inflamed gums.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a dental professional before using such products, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="6">6.

These creams often combine cinnamon with other natural ingredients like clove or eucalyptus to enhance their therapeutic effects. The warming sensation provided by cinnamon can also promote blood circulation in the gums, aiding in faster healing.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a dentist before using such creams, especially if the gum swelling is due to a more serious condition like periodontitis.</p><h2 id="7">7. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum cream" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-creams.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is often used for skin conditions and mood disorders, some studies suggest that its extracts may help reduce gum swelling due to their ability to inhibit inflammatory responses. Herbal creams containing Hypericum perforatum can be applied topically to the gums to alleviate discomfort and promote healing. These creams are generally considered safe for most people, though they may interact with certain medications.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing gum issues or systemic conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum cream" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-creams.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, contains compounds like piperine that have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a potential ingredient in herbal creams for gum swelling.</p><p>These creams often combine black pepper extract with other natural ingredients such as turmeric or neem to enhance their therapeutic effects. When applied topically, the cream may help reduce inflammation and pain associated with conditions like gingivitis or periodontitis. However, it is important to consult a dentist or healthcare professional before using such creams, as they are not a substitute for proper oral hygiene and professional dental care.</p><p>While some studies suggest the benefits of piper nigrum in reducing gum irritation, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in long-term use.</p><h2 id="9">9.

The essential oils in rosemary, such as camphor and cineole, help soothe irritated gums and prevent bacterial growth. When applied topically, rosemary herbal creams can provide relief from gum inflammation and support overall oral health.</p><p>However, individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test before using these products to avoid potential irritation.</p><h2 id="10">10. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is a herbal ingredient often used in topical creams for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>These creams can help reduce gum swelling by calming irritation and promoting tissue healing. The active compounds in calendula, such as flavonoids and triterpenes, contribute to its ability to ease inflammation and support oral health.
