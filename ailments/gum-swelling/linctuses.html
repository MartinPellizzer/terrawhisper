<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, sage can help reduce gum swelling by soothing irritated tissues and decreasing bacterial growth in the mouth. The active compounds in salvia officinalis, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to alleviate inflammation and promote healing. This natural remedy is often recommended for individuals experiencing mild gum irritation or early signs of gingivitis.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage linctus, especially for those with underlying health conditions or allergies.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Eucalyptus globulus</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/eucalyptus-globulus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus oil, is often used in herbal linctuses to help alleviate symptoms of gum swelling due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated form of eucalyptus oil diluted in a base of honey or glycerin, making them suitable for topical application to the gums. The menthol-like compounds in eucalyptus oil can help reduce inflammation and soothe irritation, providing temporary relief from discomfort. However, it is important to use these linctuses as part of a broader oral hygiene routine and consult a dentist if gum swelling persists.</p><p>While generally safe for short-term use, excessive application or ingestion should be avoided to prevent potential side effects.</p><h2 id="4">4. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita linctuse" src="/images/preparations/chamomilla-recutita-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita herbal linctuses are traditional remedies often used to alleviate symptoms of gum swelling due to their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain chamomile extract, which is known for its ability to reduce inflammation and promote healing in the oral cavity. When applied topically or used as a mouth rinse, chamomile can help soothe irritated gums and reduce discomfort associated with conditions like gingivitis. The mild, aromatic compounds in chamomile also provide a calming effect, making it a popular choice for natural oral care.</p><p>However, while generally safe for most people, individuals with allergies to plants in the daisy family should exercise caution before using chamomilla-based products.</p><h2 id="5">5. Thymus vulgaris</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris linctuse" src="/images/preparations/thymus-vulgaris-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, is a herb that has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential benefits for oral health.</p><p>Thymus vulgaris herbal linctuses are formulations that combine thyme extract with other soothing ingredients to address gum swelling and inflammation. These linctuses work by leveraging the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of thyme, which can help reduce irritation and prevent infection in the gums. The soothing effect of thyme makes it suitable for use in natural remedies for conditions like gingivitis.</p><p>Regular use of thymus vulgaris linctuses may support overall gum health and promote a more comfortable oral environment.</p><h2 id="6">6. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale linctuse" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a potential natural remedy for gum swelling.</p><p>When formulated into herbal linctuses, ginger can provide a soothing effect on inflamed gums due to its active compounds like gingerol and shogaol. These linctuses are typically applied directly to the gums, offering localized relief without systemic side effects. The antiseptic and cooling properties of ginger may help reduce bacterial growth and alleviate discomfort associated with gum inflammation.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, zingiber officinale linctuses may support oral health when used alongside conventional dental care practices.</p><h2 id="7">7. Echinacea angustifolia</h2><img alt="echinacea angustifolia linctuse" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-angustifolia-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea angustifolia, a species of the echinacea plant, has been traditionally used for its immune-boosting properties and potential anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>When formulated into herbal linctuses, it may offer a soothing effect on inflamed gums due to its mild astringent and antimicrobial properties. These linctuses are typically made by combining the dried root or herb with a base of honey or glycerin, creating a viscous preparation that can be applied directly to the gums. While some studies suggest that echinacea may reduce gum inflammation, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating gum swelling specifically.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita linctuse" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal linctuses to alleviate symptoms of gum swelling due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated form of peppermint oil, which can help reduce inflammation and irritation in the gums.

Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with treating mild depression, some studies suggest that its extracts may have potential in reducing gum swelling due to their ability to inhibit inflammatory responses. In the form of a linctus, or herbal syrup, Hypericum perforatum may be used as a complementary remedy to soothe irritated gums and reduce inflammation. However, it is important to note that its effectiveness for gum swelling has not been extensively studied in clinical trials, and it should not replace professional dental care.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if taking other medications, due to potential interactions.</p><h2 id="10">10. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, contains essential oils and compounds such as cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, which possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These properties make it a valuable ingredient in herbal linctuses used to alleviate gum swelling and reduce oral inflammation. When formulated into a linctus, cinnamon can provide a soothing effect on irritated gums, helping to ease discomfort and promote healing. The aromatic and warming nature of cinnamon also enhances the sensory experience of using the remedy, making it more palatable and effective for regular use.</p><p>However, it is important to use cinnamon-containing linctuses in moderation, as excessive use may cause irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
