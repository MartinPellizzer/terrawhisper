To prepare a decoction, herbs are typically boiled in water for an extended period, allowing the active compounds to infuse into the liquid. This infusion can then be used as a mouth rinse or applied directly to the affected areas for localized relief.</p><p>While herbal decoctions may offer a gentle and natural approach to managing gum swelling, they should complement, not replace, professional dental care.</p><div class="toc">
