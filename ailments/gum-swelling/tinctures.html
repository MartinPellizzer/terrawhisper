Herbal tinctures made from Hypericum perforatum can be applied topically to the gums to alleviate discomfort and promote healing. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness in treating gum-related conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3.

However, it is important to note that while some studies suggest echinacea may have mild anti-inflammatory effects, its efficacy for gum swelling specifically has not been conclusively proven in clinical trials. As a complementary therapy, echinacea tinctures should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, echinacea purpurea tinctures may offer some supportive benefits for gum health but should not replace conventional dental care or treatment.</p><h2 id="4">4.
