They work by forming a protective barrier over the lining of the joints, potentially reducing irritation and promoting tissue repair. Some studies suggest that mucillages may also help improve digestion and detoxification, which can indirectly benefit overall joint function.</p><p>While they are generally considered safe, individuals with allergies or specific health conditions should consult a healthcare professional before incorporating them into their arthritis management plan.</p>
