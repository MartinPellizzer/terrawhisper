However, it is important to use these oils with caution, as some, like peppermint, may actually worsen symptoms in certain individuals by increasing gastric pressure. When using essential oils, it is recommended to dilute them properly with a carrier oil and consult with a healthcare professional, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are pregnant.</p><p>Overall, while herbal essential oils may offer some relief for acid reflux, they should be used as a complementary therapy rather than a substitute for medical treatment.</p>
