While they are not a cure for gout, some studies suggest that mucillages may support the body's natural detoxification processes and help manage uric acid levels. Additionally, their anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to alleviating joint pain and swelling associated with gout.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating herbal mucillages into a gout management plan, as they may interact with medications or have contraindications for certain individuals.</p><div class="toc">
