<p>Mucus in stomach is a condition characterized by the excessive production of mucus in the stomach, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat this ailment, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional medications.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like Triphala, Aloe Vera, and Slippery Elm have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that help to reduce inflammation and promote healing in the stomach lining.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as Triphala tea, Aloe Vera juice, and Slippery Elm capsules can be used to treat mucus in the stomach, as they help to dissolve and remove excess mucus, while also soothing and protecting the stomach lining with the help of herbs like Marshmallow root, Licorice root, and Ginger.</p>
