Drinking sage tea can help soothe irritated tissues and potentially decrease bleeding by strengthening the capillary walls. It is often recommended to steep the leaves in hot water for several minutes to extract the beneficial compounds effectively.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage tea, especially for prolonged periods, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><h2 id="2">2.
