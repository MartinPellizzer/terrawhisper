These properties might help reduce inflammation and promote the repair of bleeding spots in the mouth, although more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific use. Silybum marianum herbal capsules are generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses, though they may interact with certain medications.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using this supplement for oral health concerns.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy traditionally used for its antidepressant properties, but it has also been studied for its potential to address bleeding spots in the mouth.</p><p>The herb contains compounds such as hyperforin and hypericin, which may have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects that could help reduce inflammation and promote healing of oral mucosal injuries. Some preliminary research suggests that St. John's Wort may support tissue repair and improve blood vessel integrity, which could aid in the resolution of oral bleeding spots. However, it is important to note that while some individuals may find relief using St. John's Wort capsules, more clinical evidence is needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific use.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially since it can interact with other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.

As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, ginkgo biloba may be a complementary option for supporting oral health, but it should not replace conventional medical treatments for persistent or severe bleeding in the mouth.</p><h2 id="8">8.
