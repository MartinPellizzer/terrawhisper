The idea is that the aromatic compounds in echinacea may help reduce overall tension and promote relaxation, which can indirectly alleviate jaw clenching caused by stress or anxiety. To prepare an echinacea bath, dried flowers can be steeped in warm water and then used as a bath soak, allowing the steam and scent to have a soothing effect on the body.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea baths, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
