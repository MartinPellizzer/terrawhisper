<p>Herbal teas for jaw clenching are a natural remedy used to alleviate the symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder, a condition characterized by the involuntary clenching or grinding of the jaw muscles.</p>
<p>These herbal teas offer numerous benefits, including reduced muscle tension, improved sleep quality, and a decrease in anxiety and stress levels, all of which contribute to alleviating TMJ symptoms.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas used to treat jaw clenching include peppermint, chamomile, and lavender teas, which help to relax the jaw muscles and promote a sense of calm; ginger tea, which reduces inflammation and eases pain; and passionflower tea, which has a sedative effect and helps to regulate sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Additionally, teas like valerian root, lemongrass, and hawthorn berries are also used to treat jaw clenching due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to soothe and protect the jaw and surrounding tissues.</p>

<p>
According to "Journal of ethnopharmacology", teas for jaw clenching may be beneficial due to the presence of compounds like myrcene in lemongrass tea, which has shown analgesic properties.
