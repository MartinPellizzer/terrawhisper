<p>Herbal teas for Alzheimer’s disease are a natural and holistic approach to treating the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disorder.</p>
<p>These teas are made from a variety of herbs, plants, and flowers that are believed to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-boosting properties, which can help alleviate memory loss, confusion, and other cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas that have shown promise in treating Alzheimer’s disease include ginkgo biloba, which improves blood flow to the brain and enhances cognitive function; Bacopa monnieri, which enhances memory and cognitive processing speed; lavender, which reduces anxiety and stress; green tea, which has high levels of antioxidants and may help slow down the progression of the disease; peppermint, which improves memory and focus; passionflower, which reduces anxiety and stress; and turmeric, which has anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce neuroinflammation.</p>
<p>By incorporating these herbal teas into their daily routine, individuals with Alzheimer’s disease may experience improved cognitive function, reduced symptoms, and enhanced overall well-being.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
