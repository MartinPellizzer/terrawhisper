<h2 id="1">1. Ginkgo biloba</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba capsule" src="/images/preparations/ginkgo-biloba-capsules.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal capsules are commonly used as a complementary therapy for Alzheimer’s disease due to their potential cognitive-enhancing properties.</p><p>The herb is believed to improve blood flow to the brain and may help protect nerve cells from damage. Some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba might slow the progression of cognitive decline in early-stage Alzheimer’s, although results have been mixed. Despite its popularity, the evidence supporting its efficacy for Alzheimer’s remains inconclusive, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been studied for its potential benefits in managing Alzheimer’s disease due to its active compound, curcumin.</p><p>Research suggests that curcumin may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are key factors in the progression of Alzheimer’s. Herbal capsules containing standardized curcumin extracts are often used as a complementary therapy to support cognitive function and slow disease progression. These capsules are generally well-tolerated, though some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal side effects.</p><p>While more clinical trials are needed, curcuma longa herbal capsules show promise as a natural adjunct in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2 id="3">3. Panax ginseng</h2><img alt="panax ginseng capsule" src="/images/preparations/panax-ginseng-capsules.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng, a traditional herbal remedy, has been studied for its potential benefits in managing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease due to its neuroprotective properties.</p><p>Research suggests that the active compounds in Panax ginseng, such as ginsenosides, may help improve cognitive function and memory by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Panax ginseng are often used as a complementary therapy to support brain health in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s. However, while some studies show promising results, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in this population.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Panax ginseng, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Salvia miltiorrhiza</h2><img alt="salvia miltiorrhiza capsule" src="/images/preparations/salvia-miltiorrhiza-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia miltiorrhiza, commonly known as Hu Xiang or Danshen, is a traditional Chinese herb that has been studied for its potential neuroprotective effects.</p><p>Research suggests that the active compounds in Salvia miltiorrhiza, such as tanshinone and salvianolic acid, may help improve cerebral blood flow and reduce oxidative stress, which are factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Herbal capsules containing Salvia miltiorrhiza are increasingly being explored as complementary therapy to support cognitive function in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s. While preliminary studies show promise, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in treating the disease.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Salvia miltiorrhiza for Alzheimer’s.</p><h2 id="5">5. Bacopa monnieri</h2><img alt="bacopa monnieri capsule" src="/images/preparations/bacopa-monnieri-capsules.jpg"/><p>Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is a traditional Ayurvedic herb that has been studied for its potential cognitive-enhancing properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing bacopa monnieri are often used as a complementary therapy for Alzheimer’s disease due to their purported ability to improve memory, reduce anxiety, and support neural function. Research suggests that bacopa may help in protecting brain cells from oxidative stress and promoting the growth of nerve cells, which could be beneficial in slowing cognitive decline. However, while some clinical trials show promising results, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in treating Alzheimer’s.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using bacopa monnieri, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been explored for its potential benefits in managing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>The herb is believed to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may support cognitive function and protect brain cells from damage. While preliminary studies suggest it might help in improving memory and reducing oxidative stress, more extensive clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for Alzheimer’s patients. Herbal capsules containing Cnicus benedictus are often marketed as natural supplements to complement conventional treatments.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy that has been studied for its potential benefits in managing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>While primarily used for mild to moderate depression, some research suggests it may have neuroprotective properties that could support cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer’s. These herbal capsules are often considered as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, though their efficacy and safety in Alzheimer’s patients require further clinical validation. The active compounds in Hypericum perforatum, such as hyperforin and hypericin, are believed to influence neurotransmitter levels and reduce oxidative stress in the brain.</p><p>However, due to potential interactions with other medications, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using these capsules for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2 id="8">8. Withania somnifera</h2><img alt="withania somnifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/withania-somnifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its calming and neuroprotective properties.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the active compounds in ashwagandha, such as withanolides, may support cognitive function and reduce oxidative stress, making it a potential candidate for managing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Withania somnifera are increasingly being explored as complementary therapies to enhance memory and mental clarity in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. While more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy, preliminary evidence indicates that ashwagandha may help alleviate anxiety and improve sleep, which are often associated with Alzheimer’s.</p><p>As a natural supplement, Withania somnifera offers a promising yet cautiously integrative approach to supporting brain health in the context of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2 id="9">9. Ocimum sanctum</h2><img alt="ocimum sanctum capsule" src="/images/preparations/ocimum-sanctum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Ocimum sanctum, also known as holy basil, has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its potential cognitive-enhancing properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Ocimum sanctum are increasingly being explored for their role in supporting brain health and mitigating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
