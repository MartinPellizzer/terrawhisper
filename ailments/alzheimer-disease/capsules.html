While some studies suggest potential benefits, the scientific evidence remains inconclusive, and more rigorous clinical trials are needed to establish their efficacy and safety. Herbal capsules are generally considered safe when used as directed, but they may interact with other medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>As a result, they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
