<p>Herbal teas for baldness are a type of natural remedy that utilizes plant extracts to promote hair growth, slow down hair loss, and improve scalp health.</p>

<p>Other herbal teas, like ginseng, peppermint, and ginger, can help to stimulate hair growth and improve overall scalp health, while teas like nettle leaf, burdock root, and lavender can help to soothe and calm the scalp.</p>

According to "International journal of molecular sciences", teas for baldness such as Camellia sinensis (black tea) have been studied for their potential to reduce the rate of hair loss or stimulate new hair growth due to the presence of flavonoids.
