The essential oil is often used in aromatherapy and topical applications, but it is important to note that it should not be applied directly to the eyes without proper dilution and consultation with a healthcare professional. Due to the sensitivity of the eye area, caution is necessary when using any essential oil near the eyes, and it is generally recommended to use it in a diffuser or as a diluted topical treatment.</p><p>Overall, while Vitex essential oil may have some supportive benefits, it is not a primary treatment for eye pain and should complement, not replace, professional medical care.</p><h2 id="4">4.

The oil is more commonly used for muscle pain, bruises, and joint inflammation rather than eye-related issues. For eye pain, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional and use safer, eye-friendly alternatives such as chamomile or calendula essential oils.</p><p>Always ensure that any essential oil is properly diluted before use, and avoid contact with the eyes to prevent potential harm.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis essential oil" src="/images/preparations/essential-oils/salvia-officinalis-essential-oils.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, contains essential oils that have been traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>These essential oils, which include compounds like thujone and camphor, may help alleviate eye pain by reducing inflammation and soothing irritated tissues.
