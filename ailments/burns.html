<p>Burns is a type of injury that occurs when the skin is exposed to heat, flames, or electricity, causing damage to the skin and underlying tissues.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat burns, offering numerous benefits such as promoting wound healing, reducing inflammation, and preventing infection.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like aloe vera, calendula, and tea tree oil are commonly used to treat burns due to their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which help soothe and protect the affected area.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as aloe vera gel, calendula cream, and herbal teas like peppermint, chamomile, and licorice root can be used to treat burns, with the aloe vera gel providing cooling relief, while the herbal teas can help promote relaxation and reduce stress.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes burns?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of burns are direct contact with flames or heat sources, such as fire, stovetops, or ovens, as well as exposure to electrical or chemical substances.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of burns can include scalds from hot liquids or steam, explosions, or friction burns from intense physical activity or accidents.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing burns include working in high-temperature industries, such as welding or manufacturing, or engaging in activities that involve open flames, like cooking or smoking.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals who live in areas prone to natural disasters, such as wildfires, may also be at a higher risk of experiencing burns.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal burns?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat burns are Aloe vera, Plantain, and Gotu kola, which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help soothe and heal burn wounds.</p>
<p>Aloe vera contains bioactive compounds such as acemannan, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that aid in tissue repair and regeneration.</p>
<p>Plantain has therapeutic actions like debridement and tissue repair, attributed to its high concentration of allantoin, a compound that promotes wound healing and reduces inflammation.</p>
<p>Gotu kola, rich in bioactive compounds like asiatic acid and madecassic acid, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that accelerate burn wound healing and tissue regeneration.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat burns?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat burns are often in the form of teas or infusions, which are made from plants that have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>A cooling compress infused from a specific plant can help reduce pain and promote the healing of second-degree burns, while a topical application of a soothing balm made from another plant can aid in the repair of damaged skin.</p>
<p>Additionally, a drink made from a plant known for its antioxidant properties can help to reduce the risk of infection and promote the growth of new tissue, while a paste made from a plant with antiseptic properties can be applied directly to the affected area to prevent infection.</p>
<p>These herbal preparations can be used in combination to provide comprehensive relief and promote the healing of burns.</p>
