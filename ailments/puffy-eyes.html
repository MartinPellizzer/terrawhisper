<p>Puffy eyes is a common condition characterized by swelling and discoloration around the eyes, often caused by allergies, sinus infections, or fluid retention.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat puffy eyes, offering a natural and effective approach to alleviate this condition.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as chamomile, calendula, and peppermint have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce swelling and soothe the skin.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye creams containing witch hazel, aloe vera, and green tea extracts can also be applied to reduce puffiness and promote relaxation, while herbal teas like nettle, dandelion, and ginger can be consumed to help reduce fluid retention and alleviate sinus congestion.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes puffy eyes?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of puffy eyes are allergies, sinus infections, and fluid retention due to hormonal changes, which cause the eyelids to swell and become inflamed.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include excessive sodium consumption, lack of sleep, and certain medications such as birth control pills and steroids, which exacerbate fluid retention and worsen puffy eyes.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing puffy eyes include a diet high in processed foods and sodium, as well as a sedentary lifestyle and prolonged screen time, which can lead to fluid retention and eye strain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, individuals who experience frequent stress, travel to areas with high pollen counts, or have a family history of allergies are also at a higher risk of developing puffy eyes.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal puffy eyes?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat puffy eyes are Cucumber, Aloe Vera, and Chamomile, which have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p>
<p>Cucumber contains bioactive compounds like fisetin, which has anti-inflammatory effects and helps reduce swelling, while Aloe Vera contains compounds like aloin and aloe-emodin, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Chamomile, on the other hand, contains apigenin, a flavonoid that has anti-inflammatory and soothing effects, helping to calm the skin and reduce puffiness.</p>
<p>These herbs work therapeutically by reducing inflammation, calming the skin, and improving circulation to help alleviate puffy eyes.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat puffy eyes?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat puffy eyes are often in the form of cooling compresses made from steeped teas or infusions, which help to constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling.</p>
<p>Cold infusions can also be used to apply a soothing and numbing effect to the affected area, providing immediate relief.</p>
<p>Warm baths infused with specific herbs can be taken to relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing the body to naturally flush out excess fluids and reduce puffiness.</p>
<p>Additionally, chilled eye wraps made from steeped herbs can be applied directly to the eyes to provide a concentrated dose of anti-inflammatory and cooling properties.</p>
