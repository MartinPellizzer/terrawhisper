Unlike synthetic medications, herbal mucillages are generally considered safe and gentle, though they may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain allergies or medical conditions.</p><p>Incorporating these mucillages into a balanced diet or as part of a holistic approach can provide relief and support digestive health.</p>
