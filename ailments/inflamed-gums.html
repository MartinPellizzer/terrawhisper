<p>Inflamed gums, also known as gingivitis, is a common dental condition characterized by redness, swelling, and tenderness of the gums, often caused by poor oral hygiene, plaque buildup, or other underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat inflamed gums, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as aloe vera, chamomile, and eucalyptus have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help soothe and calm inflamed gums, while others like peppermint, sage, and tea tree oil aid in reducing plaque and preventing further inflammation.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like mouthwashes, toothpaste, and infusions made from herbs like neem, licorice root, and myrrh can be used to treat inflamed gums, with neem being particularly effective in reducing bacterial growth and licorice root helping to soothe and calm the gums.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes inflamed gums?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of inflamed gums are poor oral hygiene and the presence of plaque or tartar on the teeth, which can lead to a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of inflamed gums may include smoking, as it reduces blood flow to the gums and makes them more susceptible to inflammation, as well as diabetes, which can impair the body's ability to heal and fight off infections.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing inflamed gums include a diet high in sugar and processed foods, which can lead to an overgrowth of bacteria in the mouth, as well as a lack of regular exercise, which can contribute to overall poor health.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who work in environments where they are frequently exposed to dust or other particles that can irritate the gums, such as construction workers, may also be at risk.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal inflamed gums?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat inflamed gums are aloe vera, calendula, and licorice root, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help soothe and protect the affected area.</p>
<p>Aloe vera, for instance, contains bioactive compounds like aloin and aloe-emodin that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions, reducing swelling and preventing infection.</p>
<p>Calendula, on the other hand, contains triterpenoids and flavonoids that promote wound healing and reduce inflammation, while licorice root's glycyrrhizin helps to reduce inflammation and prevent further irritation.</p>
<p>These herbs can be used topically or orally to provide relief from inflamed gums and promote overall oral health.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat inflamed gums?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat inflamed gums are diverse and effective, with various teas, infusions, and extracts that reduce inflammation and promote healing, such as a warm tea taken after meals to soothe the gums, a mouthwash made from a strong infusion to disinfect and calm the affected area, a cooling extract applied topically to numb the pain, and a gargle made from a concentrated infusion to reduce swelling and promote tissue repair.</p>
<p>These preparations also help to reduce bacterial growth, fight infection, and ease discomfort.</p>
<p>A liquid extract taken sublingually can also help to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, while a powder mixed with water can be used as a mouthwash to combat bad breath and gum inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, a cold infusion used as a compress can help to constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling.</p>
