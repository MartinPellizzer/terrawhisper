These syrups may help reduce bacterial buildup in the mouth, which is a primary cause of gum disease. While some studies suggest echinacea can enhance the bodyâ€™s immune response, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy specifically for gum infections.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cinnamomum zeylanicum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum zeylanicum syrup" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-zeylanicum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum, commonly known as cinnamon, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a valuable ingredient in herbal syrups for treating gum infections.</p><p>The essential oils in cinnamon, particularly cinnamaldehyde, help combat bacteria that cause periodontal diseases, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis.
