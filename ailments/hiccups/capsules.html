Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential soothing effects on the digestive system.</p><p>When formulated into capsules, glycyrrhiza glabra may help alleviate hiccups by reducing irritation in the throat and esophagus, which are common triggers for persistent hiccups. The active compounds in licorice root, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, are believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties that may calm the diaphragm and reduce involuntary contractions. However, long-term use of licorice root capsules should be approached with caution, as excessive intake can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using glycyrrhiza glabra capsules for hiccups, especially for individuals with preexisting health conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cinnamomum-verum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential soothing properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it may help alleviate hiccups by calming the gastrointestinal tract and reducing spasms.

Citron (Citrus aurantium)</h2><img alt="citrus aurantium capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/citrus-aurantium-capsules.jpg"/><p>Citrus aurantium, also known as bitter orange, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat various digestive issues, including hiccups.</p><p>The active compounds in citrus aurantium, such as synephrine and naringin, are believed to help relax the diaphragm and reduce the frequency of hiccups by influencing nerve signals. Herbal capsules made from citrus aurantium are often taken in small doses to avoid potential side effects, as high concentrations may cause stimulant-like effects. These capsules are typically available in health stores and online, and they are often combined with other herbs like ginger or peppermint for enhanced efficacy.</p><p>While some people find relief from hiccups using citrus aurantium capsules, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with underlying health conditions or who are taking other medications.</p>
