Herbal creams made from fennel can be applied topically to the chest or throat area to help soothe the nerves associated with hiccups.

Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/zingiber-officinale-creams.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its digestive and soothing properties, and recent studies suggest that ginger-based herbal creams may offer relief for hiccups by reducing muscle spasms in the diaphragm.</p><p>These creams typically contain concentrated extracts of fresh or dried ginger root, which possess anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects that can help relax the muscles responsible for hiccups. When applied topically to the chest or neck, the warmth and active compounds in the cream may stimulate circulation and ease the persistent, involuntary contractions that cause hiccups. While more research is needed to confirm their efficacy, many users report a noticeable reduction in the frequency and duration of hiccups after using ginger herbal creams.</p><p>As a natural alternative to over-the-counter remedies, ginger-based creams are often preferred for their mild, side-effect-free profile.</p><h2 id="5">5.
