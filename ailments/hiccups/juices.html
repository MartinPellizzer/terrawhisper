These juices are typically consumed in small amounts, as excessive intake of licorice can lead to side effects like hypertension due to its effect on sodium retention.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice root juice, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
