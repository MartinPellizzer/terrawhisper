The active compounds in black pepper, such as piperine, are believed to enhance the absorption of other medicinal ingredients and support the body's natural healing processes. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using piper nigrum linctuses, as they may interact with certain medications or exacerbate existing conditions.</p><p>Despite its historical use, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for stomach pain remains limited, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="6">6.

It is believed to help soothe the lining of the stomach and reduce inflammation, making it beneficial for conditions like gastritis or indigestion. The mild and pleasant taste of the linctus makes it suitable for regular use, especially for those seeking natural relief.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, particularly if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="9">9.
