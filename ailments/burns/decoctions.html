These decoctions can be applied topically to minor burns to reduce redness, swelling, and pain while promoting skin regeneration. However, it is important to ensure that the decoction is properly prepared and not used on severe burns, as medical attention may be necessary.</p><p>Overall, calendula officinalis decoctions offer a natural and gentle option for supporting the healing process in mild burn cases.</p><h2 id="2">2. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis decoction" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been widely used for its soothing and healing properties, particularly in the treatment of burns.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from aloe vera gel or leaves are often prepared by simmering the plant material in water to extract its active compounds. These decoctions are believed to possess anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and wound-healing properties that aid in the recovery of burn wounds. When applied topically, the decoction can help reduce pain, redness, and scarring associated with burns.</p><p>However, it is important to ensure proper preparation and hygiene to avoid contamination and potential adverse reactions.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These decoctions are often prepared by simmering the plant material in water for an extended period to extract its active compounds. While some traditional practitioners use Cnicus benedictus as a supportive treatment for burns, it is important to note that modern medical advice should always be sought for severe or extensive burn cases.</p><p>Further scientific research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of Cnicus benedictus in burn treatment.</p><h2 id="8">8. Plantago major</h2><img alt="plantago major decoction" src="/images/preparations/plantago-major-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Plantago major, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and healing properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from the leaves of Plantago major can be prepared by simmering the dried leaves in water to extract their active compounds.

Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina decoction" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as dog rose, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and healing properties, particularly for burns.</p><p>The herbal decoction of Rosa canina is prepared by simmering the dried rose hips in water, allowing the beneficial compounds such as flavonoids and vitamin C to infuse into the liquid.
