Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to support immune function and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is not a primary treatment for burns, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may aid in the healing process of minor burns by reducing redness and swelling.
