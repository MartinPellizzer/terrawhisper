These oils can be diffused, inhaled directly, or applied topically to the chest and throat to promote easier breathing and reduce mucus buildup. However, it is important to dilute essential oils properly before use, as they are highly concentrated and can cause skin irritation if applied undiluted.</p><p>While they may offer natural relief, they should not replace medical advice, especially for persistent or severe respiratory conditions.</p><div class="toc">
