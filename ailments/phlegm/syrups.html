The essential oils in fennel, such as anethol and fenchone, contribute to its effectiveness in reducing mucus viscosity and supporting respiratory health.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using fennel syrups, especially for children or individuals with existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/glycyrrhiza-glabra-syrups.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, is widely used in herbal syrups to help alleviate symptoms associated with excessive phlegm.</p><p>The active compound, glycyrrhizin, has mucolytic and anti-inflammatory properties that can loosen mucus and reduce irritation in the respiratory tract. These syrups are often prescribed for conditions like bronchitis, coughs, and other respiratory infections where phlegm production is a concern. However, long-term use of licorice-based syrups may lead to side effects such as hypertension and potassium loss due to its impact on the adrenal glands.</p><p>As a result, it is important to use these syrups under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><h2 id="7">7. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/salvia-officinalis-syrups.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits, including its role in managing phlegm.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from sage are often prepared by infusing the dried leaves in water or alcohol, creating a concentrated liquid that can be taken orally.

The active compounds in elderberries, such as flavonoids and anthocyanins, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may support the body's natural clearance of mucus. While some studies suggest that elderberry may reduce the duration and severity of colds and flu, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for specific respiratory symptoms like phlegm.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with chronic respiratory conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.
