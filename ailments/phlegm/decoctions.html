The warming properties of black pepper may also help soothe irritated airways and improve overall respiratory function.</p><p>While some studies suggest that piperine may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating phlegm-related conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Thymus vulgaris</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris decoction" src="/images/preparations/thymus-vulgaris-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its respiratory benefits, including its ability to help alleviate symptoms associated with phlegm.</p><p>Thyme contains volatile oils, such as thymol and carvacrol, which possess antimicrobial and expectorant properties that can loosen and expel mucus from the respiratory tract.

Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare decoction" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its expectorant properties, particularly in the treatment of phlegm-related respiratory conditions.</p><p>A decoction of fennel seeds or leaves is often prepared by simmering the dried plant material in water for several minutes, allowing the active compounds such as anethole and fenchone to be extracted. This herbal preparation is believed to help loosen and expel mucus from the respiratory tract, making it beneficial for individuals suffering from bronchitis, coughs, or congestion. The warming and aromatic nature of fennel decoctions can also soothe the throat and reduce irritation.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using fennel decoctions, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with known allergies or medical conditions.</p><h2 id="10">10.
