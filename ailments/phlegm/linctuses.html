However, prolonged use of licorice-based products may lead to side effects such as hypertension due to its effect on sodium and potassium balance.</p><p>As a result, it is recommended to use licorice linctuses under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Pimpinella anisum</h2><img alt="pimpinella anisum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/pimpinella-anisum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Pimpinella anisum, commonly known as anise, is a traditional herbal remedy often used in the formulation of linctuses to help alleviate symptoms of phlegm and cough.</p><p>The essential oils in anise, particularly anethol, possess expectorant properties that aid in loosening mucus and making it easier to expel from the respiratory tract.

The soothing effects of chamomile may help to reduce irritation in the throat and ease coughing, making it a popular choice for natural remedies. While it is generally considered safe for short-term use, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using chamomile linctuses, especially for children or individuals with allergies.</p><p>Overall, chamomile-based linctuses offer a gentle, plant-based option for managing phlegm-related discomfort.</p><h2 id="9">9. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, is traditionally used in herbal linctuses to help alleviate symptoms associated with phlegm and respiratory congestion.</p><p>The essential oils derived from its bark contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, which possess expectorant and antimicrobial properties that can help loosen mucus and reduce infection risk.
