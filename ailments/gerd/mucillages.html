They also promote a sense of fullness, which may help in reducing the frequency of acid reflux episodes. Additionally, many herbal mucillages are rich in fiber and antioxidants, which support overall digestive health and may alleviate symptoms associated with GERD.</p><p>Incorporating these natural remedies into a balanced diet, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, can be a beneficial complementary approach to managing GERD.</p>
