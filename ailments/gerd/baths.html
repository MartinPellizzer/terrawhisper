Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/camellia-sinensis-baths.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, has been traditionally used in herbal baths for its calming and soothing properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, it can help reduce inflammation and promote relaxation, which may alleviate symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Anise (Pimpinella anisum)</h2><img alt="pimpinella anisum bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/pimpinella-anisum-baths.jpg"/><p>Pimpinella anisum, commonly known as anise, has been traditionally used in herbal baths for its calming and digestive properties, which may offer relief for individuals suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p>The essential oils and compounds found in anise, such as anethol, are believed to have mild antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects that may help soothe the digestive tract.

This natural approach offers a calming alternative to conventional treatments, helping to ease discomfort without harsh side effects.</p><p>Incorporating Rosa canina herbal baths into a daily routine may complement other GERD management strategies, such as dietary changes and lifestyle adjustments.</p><h2 id="10">10.

The warm water combined with fennel's aromatic compounds may promote relaxation, which in turn can ease the pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter. While herbal baths are not a substitute for medical treatment, they may serve as a complementary therapy to support overall digestive health.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using fennel baths, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p>
