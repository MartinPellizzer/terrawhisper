However, more clinical studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms and efficacy of these oils in managing fluid retention.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using urtica dioica essential oils, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="3">3.
