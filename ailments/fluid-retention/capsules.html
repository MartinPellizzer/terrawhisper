<h2 id="1">1. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement often used for its potential liver-protective properties.</p><p>While it is primarily studied for its effects on liver health, some research suggests it may also support the body's natural processes in managing fluid retention. The active compound, silymarin, is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could help reduce fluid buildup in tissues. However, more clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy specifically for fluid retention.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica capsule" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herb that has been traditionally used for its diuretic properties, making it a popular ingredient in herbal capsules for managing fluid retention.</p><p>These capsules are often formulated to support the body's natural ability to eliminate excess fluids by promoting kidney function and reducing water retention in tissues. The active compounds in Urtica dioica, such as flavonoids and minerals like potassium, are believed to contribute to its effectiveness in reducing swelling and edema. Many individuals use these capsules as a natural alternative to pharmaceutical diuretics, especially for mild cases of fluid retention related to diet, menstruation, or hormonal changes.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is often used in herbal formulations to address fluid retention due to its diuretic properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Cnicus benedictus are designed to support the body's natural processes in eliminating excess fluids, which can help reduce swelling and bloating. These capsules are typically made from standardized extracts to ensure consistent potency and efficacy. They are often recommended as a natural alternative to synthetic diuretics, though they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>While generally considered safe, they may interact with certain medications, so it is important to consult a physician before use.</p><h2 id="4">4. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy often used to support hormonal balance and may help alleviate symptoms of fluid retention.</p><p>This herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland, potentially regulating the production of prolactin and other hormones that can contribute to fluid retention. Herbal capsules containing vitex agnus-castus are typically standardized to ensure consistent potency and are often taken as a dietary supplement. While some studies suggest it may help reduce swelling and bloating, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for fluid retention.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense capsule" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-capsules.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its diuretic properties, making it a popular choice for addressing fluid retention.</p><p>The herbal capsules containing Equisetum arvense are formulated to support the body's natural process of eliminating excess fluids through the urinary system. These capsules are often recommended for individuals experiencing swelling in the legs, ankles, or hands due to water retention. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Equisetum arvense, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for fluid retention remains limited, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="6">6. Symphytum officinale</h2><img alt="symphytum officinale capsule" src="/images/preparations/symphytum-officinale-capsules.jpg"/><p>Symphytum officinale, commonly known as comfrey, is a herbal remedy traditionally used for its potential benefits in reducing fluid retention.</p><p>While it contains compounds like allantoin that may support tissue repair and reduce inflammation, its use for fluid retention is not well-supported by modern scientific research. Some herbal practitioners suggest that comfrey may help in reducing swelling by improving lymphatic drainage, but this claim lacks robust clinical evidence. Due to the risk of liver toxicity associated with long-term use, it is generally not recommended for prolonged or regular consumption.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Symphytum officinale, especially for conditions involving fluid retention.</p><h2 id="7">7. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina capsule" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-capsules.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support fluid balance in the body.</p><p>The herbal capsules containing Rosa canina extract are often recommended for individuals experiencing fluid retention, as they are believed to promote the elimination of excess fluids through natural diuretic properties. These capsules typically contain standardized extracts of the rose hips, which are rich in bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, vitamin C, and essential oils.

Herbal capsules containing foeniculum vulgare are a convenient and standardized way to consume this herb, making it accessible for those seeking natural support for fluid balance. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using fennel supplements, especially for individuals with kidney conditions or those on medication.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in managing fluid retention.</p><h2 id="9">9. Leonurus cardiaca</h2><img alt="leonurus cardiaca capsule" src="/images/preparations/leonurus-cardiaca-capsules.jpg"/><p>Leonurus cardiaca, commonly known as heart herb or red deadnettle, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential diuretic properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Leonurus cardiaca are often marketed for their ability to support the body's natural fluid balance and alleviate symptoms of fluid retention. The plant is believed to help reduce swelling by promoting the excretion of excess fluids through the kidneys. While some studies suggest it may have mild diuretic effects, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for this purpose.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.
