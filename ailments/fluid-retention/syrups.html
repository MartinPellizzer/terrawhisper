Herbal syrups containing vitex agnus-castus are typically made from the dried berries and are often combined with other herbs like licorice root or fennel for enhanced efficacy. These syrups are generally considered safe for short-term use, though they should be avoided during pregnancy and by individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting treatment for fluid retention.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While some studies suggest that milk thistle may aid in reducing edema by supporting liver health, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for fluid retention. Herbal syrups containing silybum marianum are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for conditions like edema or liver disease.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using milk thistle syrup, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compounds in stinging nettle, such as silica, potassium, and flavonoids, are believed to contribute to its effectiveness in managing water retention. Herbal syrups made from Urtica dioica are often used as a natural alternative to conventional diuretic medications.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using this remedy, especially for individuals with kidney conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus syrup" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-syrups.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as St. Benedict's herb, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to address fluid retention, particularly in the context of lymphatic and circulatory health.</p><p>Its active compounds, including flavonoids and saponins, are believed to support the body's natural drainage processes by enhancing the function of the lymphatic system. Herbal syrups made from Cnicus benedictus are often formulated to be gentle and palatable, making them suitable for long-term use in managing mild to moderate fluid retention.

Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina syrup" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-syrups.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support overall health and wellness.</p><p>Rosa canina herbal syrups are often formulated with concentrated rosehip extract, which is rich in essential nutrients such as vitamin C, antioxidants, and bioflavonoids. These syrups are believed to help reduce fluid retention by promoting lymphatic drainage and improving circulation, making them a popular choice for individuals experiencing mild swelling or edema. The anti-inflammatory properties of rosehip may also contribute to reducing water retention by supporting the body's natural detoxification processes.</p><p>When used as part of a balanced diet and lifestyle, rosa canina herbal syrups can be a natural and supportive option for managing fluid retention.</p><h2 id="6">6. Petroselinum crispum</h2><img alt="petroselinum crispum syrup" src="/images/preparations/petroselinum-crispum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Petroselinum crispum, commonly known as parsley, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its diuretic properties, which can help reduce fluid retention.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from parsley are believed to support the body's natural processes in eliminating excess water by promoting urine production. These syrups are often prepared by combining fresh or dried parsley with honey or other natural sweeteners to enhance flavor and bioavailability. While parsley is generally considered safe, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially for individuals with kidney conditions or those on medication.</p><p>Overall, parsley herbal syrups may offer a natural alternative for managing mild fluid retention, though they should complement, not replace, medical advice.</p><h2 id="7">7. Althaea officinalis</h2><img alt="althaea officinalis syrup" src="/images/preparations/althaea-officinalis-syrups.jpg"/><p>Althaea officinalis, commonly known as marshmallow root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and demulcent properties.</p><p>When prepared as a syrup, it can help alleviate symptoms of fluid retention by promoting the drainage of excess fluids from the body. The mucilage in marshmallow root acts as a natural emollient, supporting the function of the lymphatic system and reducing swelling. Herbal syrups made from Althaea officinalis are often used to address mild edema and are considered a gentle, natural alternative to pharmaceutical diuretics.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these syrups, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium syrup" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-syrups.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential diuretic properties, which may help reduce fluid retention.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal syrup, yarrow can support the body's natural processes of eliminating excess fluids by promoting urine production. This syrup is often used to alleviate symptoms associated with edema, such as swelling in the legs or hands. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow syrup, especially for individuals with kidney conditions or those taking diuretic medications.</p><p>While yarrow may offer supportive benefits, it should not replace prescribed treatments for fluid retention.</p><h2 id="9">9. Nymphaea alba</h2><img alt="nymphaea alba syrup" src="/images/preparations/nymphaea-alba-syrups.jpg"/><p>Nymphaea alba, commonly known as the white water lily, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in reducing fluid retention.</p><p>The plant's roots and rhizomes are often processed into herbal syrups, which are believed to support the body's natural processes in eliminating excess fluids. These syrups are thought to work by promoting diuretic effects and improving lymphatic drainage, helping to alleviate swelling and bloating. While scientific research on Nymphaea alba is limited, its historical use suggests it may be a natural alternative for those seeking to manage fluid retention.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.

Some studies suggest that licorice can act as a mild diuretic, helping to reduce swelling and water retention, although its effects can vary depending on dosage and individual physiology. However, excessive use of licorice syrup may lead to side effects such as hypertension due to its impact on the renin-angiotensin system.</p><p>As a result, it is often recommended to use licorice-based syrups under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.</p>
