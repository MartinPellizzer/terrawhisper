Applying a few drops of the diluted essential oil to a clean cotton swab and gently pressing it against the stye may help reduce redness, swelling, and discomfort. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially if the stye is persistent or severe.</p><p>While essential oils can offer supportive care, they should not replace medical treatment for a stye that does not improve within a few days.</p>
