However, it is important to note that while some anecdotal evidence supports its use, scientific research on its efficacy for stye specifically is limited. Before using St. John's Wort juice, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional, as it can interact with certain medications.</p><p>Overall, Hypericum perforatum may offer some relief for stye symptoms, but it should not replace conventional medical treatments without professional guidance.</p><h2 id="2">2.

To make the juice, fresh nettle leaves are typically washed, blended with water, and then strained to remove the fibrous residue. It is often recommended to consume the juice internally or apply it topically with a clean cloth to soothe the affected area.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle, especially for individuals with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The antioxidants and essential nutrients in rose hip juice can reduce inflammation and promote healing in the affected area. It is often recommended as a complementary treatment alongside conventional medical care for styes.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially for eye-related conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4.

While there is limited scientific evidence specifically supporting the use of milk thistle juice for stye, some anecdotal reports suggest it may aid in reducing symptoms when applied topically or consumed internally. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using milk thistle juice, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Overall, while it may offer some supportive benefits, milk thistle should not replace conventional treatments for stye.</p><h2 id="6">6. Marigold (Calendula officinalis)</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/calendula-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is a herbal remedy often used to treat stye, a painful red bump on the eyelid caused by a bacterial infection.</p><p>Its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties make it effective in reducing swelling, redness, and discomfort associated with stye. Calendula herbal juices can be applied topically as a compress or diluted with water to create a soothing eye wash. These natural extracts help promote healing by supporting the body's immune response and preventing further infection.</p><p>Due to its gentle nature, calendula is considered a safe and alternative option for those seeking natural relief from stye symptoms.</p><h2 id="7">7. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/matricaria-chamomilla-juices.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is often used in herbal juices to help alleviate symptoms of a stye, which is an infection of the eyelid.</p><p>Chamomile contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can reduce redness, swelling, and discomfort associated with styes.

Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/achillea-millefolium-juices.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it may offer potential benefits for conditions like stye, which is an infection of the eyelid glands. The juice is believed to help reduce swelling and redness associated with styes due to its high content of flavonoids and essential oils. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow juice, as it may cause allergic reactions or interact with certain medications.</p><p>While some individuals may find relief from using yarrow-based remedies, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for styes is limited.</p><h2 id="9">9. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/salvia-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential natural remedy for stye, which is an infection of the eyelid.</p><p>Herbal juices made from fresh or dried sage leaves can be applied topically to the affected area to help reduce redness, swelling, and discomfort associated with stye. These juices contain compounds like thujone and rosmarinic acid, which may contribute to their healing effects on the eye. While sage juice may offer some relief, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if the stye persists or worsens.</p><p>Overall, sage herbal juice can be a complementary treatment to support the body's natural healing process when used safely and appropriately.</p><h2 id="10">10. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/aloe-barbadensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a natural remedy that has been used for centuries to treat various skin and eye conditions, including styes.</p><p>The gel extracted from the aloe plant contains anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can help reduce swelling and infection associated with styes. Applying aloe vera gel directly to the affected area can provide soothing relief and promote faster healing.
