<p>Fatigue is a state of physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by prolonged stress, lack of sleep, or other factors.</p>
<p>To combat fatigue, herbal remedies have been widely used due to their natural and non-invasive approach, which can help to alleviate symptoms and promote overall well-being.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Ashwagandha, Ginseng, and Rhodiola Rosea are commonly used to treat fatigue, as they have adaptogenic properties that help to reduce stress and increase energy levels.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like tea infusions, tinctures, and supplements made from herbs like Holy Basil, Licorice Root, and Schisandra Berry can also be effective in treating fatigue, as they can help to regulate the body's energy and promote a sense of calm and balance.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes fatigue?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of fatigue are sleep disorders, anemia, chronic diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism, and certain medications, which disrupt the body's normal energy production and regulation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of fatigue include depression, anxiety, and stress, which can lead to a lack of motivation and decreased energy levels, and overuse or repetitive strain injuries, which can cause physical exhaustion.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing fatigue include a sedentary lifestyle, irregular sleep patterns, and poor nutrition, which can lead to energy deficits and decreased physical function.</p>
<p>Additionally, working long hours, traveling across time zones, and engaging in high-intensity activities without adequate recovery time can also contribute to fatigue.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal fatigue?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat fatigue are adaptogenic herbs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea), which exhibit adaptogenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce oxidative stress and promote energy production.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba, rich in flavonoids and terpenoids, improves circulation and oxygen delivery to cells, alleviating fatigue.</p>
<p>Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis) and Ginseng (Panax ginseng) have been traditionally used to enhance physical performance and endurance, due to their ability to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds responsible for these effects include alkaloids, glycosides, and phenolic acids, which interact with cellular pathways to regulate energy homeostasis and combat fatigue.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat fatigue?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat fatigue are teas, infusions, and tonics that provide a boost of energy and vitality.</p>
<p>For instance, a warm, spicy tea can help increase circulation and stimulate the body, while a soothing infusion can calm the mind and promote a restful night's sleep.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations that combine stimulating and adaptogenic properties can also help regulate the body's natural rhythms and reduce fatigue, making it easier to tackle daily tasks.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations have been shown to increase oxygenation and reduce inflammation, further alleviating feelings of exhaustion and fatigue.</p>
