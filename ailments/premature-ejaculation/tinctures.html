Modern herbal formulations often dilute or modify the active compounds to reduce risks, but caution is still advised.</p><p>It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using such tinctures, as they may interact with other medications or have adverse effects on certain individuals.</p><h2 id="7">7.
