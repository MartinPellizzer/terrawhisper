When applied topically, chamomile can help reduce redness, irritation, and inflammation associated with sunburn. However, it is important to note that chamomile tea should not be used as a substitute for proper sun protection or medical treatment for severe burns.</p><p>For best results, it is recommended to cool the tea and apply it to the affected area as a compress or use it in a cool bath to provide soothing relief.</p><h2 id="2">2.
