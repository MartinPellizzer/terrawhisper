Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/cnicus-benedictus-syrups.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as sweet cicely, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and cooling properties.</p><p>While it is not a primary treatment for sunburn, some herbal syrups containing Cnicus benedictus may be used as a complementary remedy to alleviate symptoms such as redness and irritation.
