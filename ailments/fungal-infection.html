<p>Fungal infection is a type of infection caused by fungi, which are tiny organisms that can enter the body through cuts, wounds, or other openings and cause a range of symptoms, from mild to severe.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat fungal infections, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Herbs such as tea tree oil, aloe vera, turmeric, garlic, and goldenseal have antifungal properties that help combat fungal infections, while others like calendula and plantain soothe and calm irritated skin.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like ointments, salves, and tinctures can be applied directly to affected areas, or consumed internally as teas or capsules, providing targeted relief and promoting a healthy balance of the body's natural defenses.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes fungal infection?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of fungal infection are usually due to exposure to fungal spores, which can be found in damp environments, contaminated soil, and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include weakened immune systems, certain medical conditions such as diabetes, and prolonged use of antibiotics, which can disrupt the natural balance of microorganisms in the body.</p>
<p>Individuals with lifestyles that involve frequent exposure to moist environments, such as athletes or construction workers, or those who wear shoes that don't breathe, like flip flops, are more likely to develop fungal infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who use public showers or hot tubs, or engage in activities that involve handling soil, like gardening, are also at a higher risk of developing fungal infections.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal fungal infection?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat fungal infection are aloe vera, tea tree oil, and garlic, which possess therapeutic actions such as antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Aloe vera's bioactive compounds, including aloin and aloe-emodin, exhibit antifungal activity by inhibiting fungal growth and penetration of the skin.</p>
<p>Tea tree oil's bioactive compound, terpinen-4-ol, has been shown to disrupt fungal cell membranes and prevent the spread of fungal infections.</p>
<p>Garlic's bioactive compounds, such as allicin and alliin, have antimicrobial and antifungal properties that help combat fungal infections by inhibiting fungal growth and proliferation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat fungal infection?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat fungal infection are a blend of teas, infusions, and tinctures that have antifungal properties.</p>
<p>They include decoctions that help to reduce inflammation and prevent the spread of the infection, such as topical ointments and creams that can be applied directly to the affected area.</p>
<p>Some preparations are used as a wash to help clean and soothe the skin, while others are consumed as a tea or infusion to boost the immune system and promote healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations are used to reduce the itching and discomfort associated with fungal infections, promoting a faster recovery.</p>
