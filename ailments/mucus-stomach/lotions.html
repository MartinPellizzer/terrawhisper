While primarily used externally, some individuals apply fennel lotions to the abdomen to support digestion and ease symptoms of indigestion or excess mucus production. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using fennel lotions, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking medications.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of fennel lotions for internal mucus issues remains limited, and they should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum zeylanicum lotion" src="/images/preparations/lotions/cinnamomum-zeylanicum-lotions.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum, commonly known as Ceylon cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential health benefits.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal lotions, it may help soothe irritation and reduce inflammation in the stomach lining, which can contribute to mucus production. The essential oils in cinnamon are believed to have antimicrobial properties that may aid in balancing gut flora and reducing excess mucus. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon-based lotions, as they may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports its use, more scientific research is needed to fully understand its efficacy for digestive health.</p><h2 id="10">10.
