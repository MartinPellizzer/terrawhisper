Body odor is primarily caused by the breakdown of sweat by bacteria on the skin, and herbal linctuses do not target the underlying causes of perspiration or bacterial growth. As a result, they are not an effective solution for managing body odor.</p><p>For individuals concerned about body odor, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate treatments that address the root causes.</p>
