Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/valeriana-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to address symptoms such as palpitations, which are irregular or rapid heartbeats.</p><p>The active compounds in valerian root, including valepotriates and iridoids, are believed to exert a calming effect on the nervous system, potentially reducing anxiety and stress that may contribute to palpitations. Herbal capsules containing valerian officinalis are typically standardized to ensure a consistent dose of these beneficial compounds. While some studies suggest valerian may help alleviate mild palpitations associated with anxiety or insomnia, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with heart conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>As with any supplement, valerian officinalis should be used as part of a holistic approach to managing heart health.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The active compound, glycyrrhizin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive properties that could support heart health. However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and potassium deficiency, so it should be used with caution and under medical supervision.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Glycyrrhiza glabra capsules may offer some relief for individuals experiencing palpitations, but they should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Herbal capsules containing hypericum perforatum are often standardized to ensure consistent potency, making them a popular choice for those seeking natural remedies.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating palpitations specifically.</p><h2 id="5">5. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/achillea-millefolium-capsules.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits, including its possible role in managing palpitations.</p><p>The herb contains compounds such as flavonoids and essential oils that may help regulate heart rhythm and reduce nervous system overactivity, which can contribute to palpitations. Herbal capsules of Achillea millefolium are often standardized to ensure consistent potency and efficacy, making them a popular choice for those seeking natural remedies. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using yarrow, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest yarrow may support heart health, more research is needed to fully understand its effects on palpitations.</p><h2 id="6">6. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/matricaria-chamomilla-capsules.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a widely used herbal remedy that may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations due to its calming and anti-anxiety properties.</p><p>The active compounds in chamomilla, such as apigenin and essential oils, are believed to interact with the central nervous system to reduce stress and promote relaxation, which can indirectly ease heart palpitations caused by anxiety or emotional distress. Chamomile herbal capsules are often taken as a natural alternative to conventional treatments for mild cardiac symptoms, though they should not replace medical advice or prescribed therapies. These capsules are typically standardized to ensure a consistent dose of active ingredients, making them a reliable option for those seeking complementary support.</p><p>However, individuals with allergies to plants in the daisy family or those taking certain medications should consult a healthcare provider before using chamomilla supplements.</p><h2 id="7">7. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its calming properties and is sometimes incorporated into herbal capsules to support individuals experiencing palpitations.</p><p>These capsules may help regulate heart rhythm by influencing neurotransmitters and reducing stress, which are common triggers for palpitations. While some studies suggest that sage might have mild sedative effects, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific use. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage capsules, especially for those with existing heart conditions or taking medications.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, salvia officinalis herbal capsules may offer some relief, but they should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to support immune function and reduce the frequency of colds and infections.</p><p>While it is not specifically designed to treat palpitations, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help alleviate stress-related cardiovascular symptoms, including irregular heartbeats. Echinacea purpurea herbal capsules are typically standardized to contain a consistent level of active compounds, such as alkamides and flavonoids, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for individuals with heart conditions or those taking medications, as it may interact with certain drugs.</p><p>Overall, while echinacea may offer some supportive benefits for palpitations related to stress or mild inflammation, it should not replace conventional medical treatment for cardiac issues.</p><h2 id="9">9. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/rosmarinus-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a popular herbal supplement often used in capsule form to support cardiovascular health.</p><p>These capsules contain concentrated extracts of rosemary leaves, which are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.

These compounds may help reduce the workload on the heart and enhance blood flow, which can alleviate symptoms such as irregular heartbeats. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these capsules, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more clinical research is needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for treating palpitations.</p>
