<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to address symptoms such as palpitations, which are irregular or forceful heartbeats.</p><p>The active compounds in valerian root, including valerenic acid and essential oils, are believed to exert a calming effect on the nervous system, potentially reducing anxiety and stress that can trigger palpitations. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Valeriana officinalis are widely available and are typically taken in low doses to minimize side effects while maximizing therapeutic benefits. Clinical studies suggest that valerian may help regulate heart rhythm by modulating neurotransmitter activity, although more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for palpitations.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using valerian, especially for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Panax ginseng</h2><img alt="panax ginseng capsule" src="/images/preparations/panax-ginseng-capsules.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng herbal capsules are commonly used in traditional medicine for their potential to support cardiovascular health and reduce symptoms of palpitations.</p><p>These capsules contain standardized extracts of Panax ginseng, which may help regulate heart rate and improve circulation by influencing the body's stress response and hormonal balance. Some studies suggest that ginseng may enhance cardiac function and reduce the frequency of irregular heartbeats in individuals with mild arrhythmias. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Panax ginseng, especially for those with existing heart conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>While some people find relief from palpitations with ginseng, its effectiveness can vary, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="3">3. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits.</p><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra herbal capsules may help alleviate palpitations by modulating the body's stress response and influencing hormone levels, particularly cortisol. The active compound, glycyrrhizin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties that may support heart health. However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under medical supervision.</p><p>Individuals experiencing persistent palpitations should consult a healthcare provider before using glycyrrhiza glabra capsules as a treatment option.</p><h2 id="4">4. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential effects on mood and nervous system function.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild to moderate depression, some studies suggest it may also have a role in managing symptoms related to palpitations, which are irregular or rapid heartbeats. The active compounds in Hypericum perforatum, such as hyperforin and hypericin, are believed to influence neurotransmitter levels, potentially reducing anxiety and stress, which can contribute to palpitations. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting its use specifically for palpitations is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>As with any supplement, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially since it can interact with other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Withania somnifera</h2><img alt="withania somnifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/withania-somnifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to promote balance and reduce stress.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Withania somnifera may help alleviate palpitations by modulating the body's stress response and supporting cardiovascular health. The herb is believed to influence the nervous system, potentially reducing the frequency and intensity of heart palpitations caused by anxiety or hormonal imbalances. Studies suggest that ashwagandha can lower cortisol levels, which may contribute to a more stable heart rhythm.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ashwagandha, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy often used to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms related to menstrual irregularities.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing vitex agnus-castus are frequently recommended for individuals experiencing palpitations, as they may help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce stress-related hormonal fluctuations. The herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland, which can indirectly affect heart rate and rhythm by stabilizing estrogen levels. Clinical studies suggest that vitex may help reduce anxiety and irritability, both of which can contribute to palpitations.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential herbal remedy for managing palpitations.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, salvia officinalis may help regulate heart rhythm by influencing neurotransmitter activity and reducing nervous system overstimulation. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, may support cardiovascular health and reduce stress-related heart palpitations. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage capsules, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While preliminary evidence is promising, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating palpitations.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to support immune function and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is primarily promoted for its immune-boosting properties, some studies suggest it may have potential benefits in managing symptoms related to cardiovascular health, including palpitations. Echinacea capsules are typically made from the dried root and flower of the plant, and they are available in various standardized formulations. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence directly linking echinacea to the treatment of palpitations, and its effectiveness can vary among individuals.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing heart conditions or who are taking medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Crataegus oxyacantha</h2><img alt="crataegus oxyacantha capsule" src="/images/preparations/crataegus-oxyacantha-capsules.jpg"/><p>Crataegus oxyacantha, commonly known as hawthorn, is a traditional herbal remedy often used in the form of capsules to support cardiovascular health.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Crataegus oxyacantha are believed to help manage palpitations by improving heart function and regulating heart rate. The active compounds in hawthorn, such as flavonoids and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, may enhance blood flow and reduce oxidative stress, contributing to its cardiovascular benefits. These capsules are typically used as a complementary therapy under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>However, individuals with certain medical conditions or on medications should consult a physician before using hawthorn supplements.</p><h2 id="10">10. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement commonly used for its potential liver-protecting properties.</p><p>While it is primarily studied for its effects on liver health, some preliminary research suggests it may have a role in supporting cardiovascular function, which could indirectly help with palpitations. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking silybum marianum to the reduction of palpitations. As a result, it is not typically recommended as a primary treatment for palpitations without further clinical trials.</p><p>Individuals experiencing frequent or severe palpitations should consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
