<p>Herbal teas for palpitation are a type of natural remedy that involves the consumption of tea made from various herbs to alleviate symptoms of irregular heartbeat or palpitations.</p>
<p>These herbal teas offer several benefits, including reducing anxiety and stress, regulating heart rate, and improving overall cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas used to treat palpitation include peppermint tea, which helps to calm the nervous system and reduce anxiety, chamomile tea, which promotes relaxation and reduces stress, hawthorn tea, which helps to lower blood pressure and improve heart function, dandelion tea, which acts as a natural diuretic to reduce fluid retention and alleviate heart palpitations, and passionflower tea, which helps to calm the nervous system and reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as ginger tea, lavender tea, and lemon balm tea are also used to treat palpitations due to their calming and regulating effects on the heart and nervous system.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>
According to "Journal of the American Nutrition Association", teas for palpitation may be beneficial due to the presence of catechins, which exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and regulate intracellular second messenger levels, potentially helping to alleviate palpitation.
