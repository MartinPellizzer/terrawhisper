Some studies suggest that the active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may help regulate mood and reduce anxiety, which are common triggers for palpitations. However, it is important to note that while topical creams may provide some comfort, they are not a substitute for medical treatment of underlying heart conditions.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you are taking other medications, as St. John's Wort can interact with various drugs.</p><h2 id="6">6.
