The active compound, glycyrrhizin, may help regulate blood pressure and reduce stress-induced heart rate fluctuations, which can contribute to palpitations. These lozenges are typically used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for heart-related symptoms.</p><p>However, long-term use should be monitored due to potential side effects, including hypertension and electrolyte imbalances.</p><h2 id="2">2. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to address nervous system-related issues, including palpitations.</p><p>Valerian root contains compounds such as valerenic acid and sesquiterpene lactones, which are believed to have calming effects on the body by enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that reduces neuronal excitability. Herbal lozenges made from valeriana officinalis are designed to provide a convenient and palatable form of the herb, allowing for easy consumption and sustained release of its active ingredients. These lozenges may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations caused by anxiety, stress, or insomnia by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using valerian-based products, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla lozenge" src="/images/preparations/matricaria-chamomilla-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a herbal remedy often used for its calming and soothing properties.</p><p>Chamomile lozenges may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations by reducing stress and anxiety, which are common triggers for irregular heartbeats.

These lozenges can be a natural alternative for individuals seeking relief from palpitations without the use of pharmaceutical medications.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile lozenges, especially for those with existing heart conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4.

These lozenges may help regulate the nervous system and reduce anxiety, which can contribute to heart palpitations. While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, they may offer supportive benefits when used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a qualified practitioner to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health needs.</p><h2 id="5">5. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, also known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal lozenges, it may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations by promoting cardiovascular comfort and reducing stress-related heart rhythm disturbances. The essential oils in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, are believed to have mild calming effects on the nervous system, which can indirectly support heart health. These lozenges are often used as a natural remedy to ease mild palpitations associated with anxiety or respiratory conditions.</p><p>However, while they may offer some symptomatic relief, they should not replace professional medical advice for persistent or severe cardiac issues.</p><h2 id="6">6. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential to alleviate symptoms associated with palpitations.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from ginger are often formulated to provide a soothing effect on the throat while promoting circulation and reducing inflammation. These lozenges may help ease the sensation of heart palpitations by improving blood flow and reducing stress-related symptoms. However, while some individuals may find relief from ginger's natural anti-inflammatory and calming effects, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them for persistent or severe palpitations.</p><p>Overall, ginger lozenges can be a complementary remedy, but they should not replace medical treatment for underlying cardiac conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Panax ginseng</h2><img alt="panax ginseng lozenge" src="/images/preparations/panax-ginseng-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng herbal lozenges are traditionally used to support cardiovascular health and may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations by promoting balanced heart function.</p><p>These lozenges contain standardized extracts of Panax ginseng, which is known for its adaptogenic properties that help the body manage stress and enhance energy levels. Some studies suggest that ginseng may regulate heart rhythm and reduce the frequency of irregular heartbeats, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for palpitations. The lozenges are often preferred for their convenience and ease of use, allowing for consistent dosing throughout the day.</p><p>However, individuals experiencing persistent palpitations should consult a healthcare professional to rule out underlying medical conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its calming and antispasmodic properties, making it a potential natural remedy for palpitations.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing salvia officinalis may help reduce the frequency and intensity of heart palpitations by promoting relaxation and balancing nervous system activity. These lozenges are often formulated with other herbs like licorice root or valerian to enhance their soothing effects. While research on sage's specific impact on palpitations is limited, its traditional use suggests it may support cardiovascular health and reduce stress-induced heart irregularities.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing heart conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea lozenge" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal lozenges are traditionally used to support immune function and may offer some benefits for individuals experiencing palpitations by reducing inflammation and stress-related symptoms.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking echinacea to the reduction of palpitations, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help alleviate underlying conditions that contribute to cardiac irregularities. These lozenges are often used as a natural remedy for colds and sore throats, which can indirectly impact heart rhythm through systemic stress or infection. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially for individuals with preexisting heart conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>Overall, echinacea purpurea lozenges may provide general wellness benefits, but they should not be relied upon as a primary treatment for palpitations without medical guidance.</p><h2 id="10">10. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa lozenge" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a bioactive compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from Curcuma longa may help alleviate symptoms of palpitations by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system. These lozenges are often used as a natural alternative to conventional medications for managing irregular heartbeats. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using turmeric lozenges, especially for individuals with underlying heart conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of Curcuma longa in treating palpitations.</p>
