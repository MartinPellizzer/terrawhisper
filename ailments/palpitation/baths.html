<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a herbal remedy traditionally used for its calming effects on the nervous system.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal baths, valerian can help alleviate symptoms of palpitations by promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety, which are common triggers for heart irregularities. The essential oils and active compounds in valerian, such as valerenic acid, have sedative properties that may ease the body's stress response and support cardiovascular balance. To prepare a valerian bath, steep dried valerian root in hot water, then add the infusion to a warm bath, allowing the soothing aromas to permeate the skin and atmosphere.</p><p>While herbal baths can be a complementary therapy, they should not replace medical advice, and individuals with severe cardiac conditions should consult a healthcare professional before use.</p><h2 id="2">2.
