These compounds may help enhance gastric motility and stimulate the production of digestive enzymes, thereby improving appetite in individuals experiencing a lack of it. Herbal decoctions made from ginger are often consumed warm, either on their own or combined with other herbs like peppermint or fennel for enhanced effects.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using ginger decoctions, especially for prolonged periods or in conjunction with other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
