Herbal juices made from vitex agnus-castus are often combined with other herbs like ginger or fennel to enhance their digestive benefits. These juices are typically consumed in small quantities to avoid bitterness and are best taken in the morning on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex agnus-castus, especially for individuals with hormonal disorders or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to stimulate appetite and aid digestion.</p><p>Its juice, often prepared from the young leaves and stems, is believed to help combat loss of appetite by enhancing gastrointestinal function and improving nutrient absorption.
