However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for eye-related issues. Additionally, St. John's wort can interact with various medications, including those used for eye treatments, so caution is advised.</p><p>Individuals experiencing eye irritation should consult a healthcare professional before using hypericum perforatum or any herbal supplement.</p><h2 id="2">2.
