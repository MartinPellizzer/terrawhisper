The essential oils in chamomile, particularly bisabolol and alpha-bisabolol, have been shown to have calming effects on the skin and mucous membranes. To prepare a chamomile bath for eye relief, steep a handful of dried chamomile flowers in hot water for several minutes, then allow the solution to cool before using it as a compress or adding it to a warm bath.</p><p>While generally safe, it is advisable to perform a patch test and consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The warm water of the bath helps to open pores and promote circulation, allowing the beneficial compounds in rosehip to penetrate the skin and potentially ease eye-related stress. While herbal baths are not a direct treatment for eye conditions, they can support overall eye health by reducing systemic inflammation and promoting relaxation.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using rosehip baths, especially if eye irritation persists or is accompanied by other symptoms.</p><h2 id="6">6.

The astringent qualities of horsetail can also help tighten blood vessels and reduce swelling, providing relief from conditions like conjunctivitis or styes. However, it is important to use the herb in moderation and avoid direct contact with the eyes to prevent irritation.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using equisetum arvense for eye-related concerns.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to soothe eye irritation due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, sage can help reduce redness and discomfort by calming the delicate tissues around the eyes.
