Herbal linctuses containing vitex agnus-castus are sometimes used as a complementary therapy to alleviate pain and stiffness associated with frozen shoulder. These formulations may help improve joint mobility by reducing swelling and promoting tissue healing.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using vitex-based linctuses, as individual responses and interactions with other medications can vary.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea linctuse" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used for its potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While primarily recognized for its use in colds and respiratory infections, some studies suggest that echinacea may have applications in reducing inflammation and pain associated with conditions like frozen shoulder. Herbal linctuses containing echinacea purpurea are sometimes used as complementary therapy to help alleviate the discomfort and stiffness characteristic of frozen shoulder. These linctuses may provide a soothing effect when inhaled, potentially offering relief from respiratory symptoms that often accompany shoulder pain.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea-based products, as individual responses and potential interactions can vary.</p><h2 id="3">3. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa linctuse" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a compound with potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a promising natural remedy for frozen shoulder.</p><p>When formulated into herbal linctuses, curcuma longa can provide a soothing effect on the affected joints and surrounding tissues, helping to reduce stiffness and pain. These linctuses are typically made by combining turmeric extract with a base of honey or glycerin, enhancing its palatability and bioavailability. The application of curcuma longa linctuses may support improved range of motion and overall joint function in individuals suffering from frozen shoulder.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these remedies, especially if other medical conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="4">4.

While there is limited clinical evidence specifically supporting the use of ginger linctuses for frozen shoulder, some studies suggest that ginger can improve circulation and alleviate pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions. As a natural remedy, ginger linctuses may be considered as an adjunct to conventional treatments such as physiotherapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra linctuse" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When formulated into linctuses, it can provide relief for symptoms associated with frozen shoulder, such as pain and stiffness.
