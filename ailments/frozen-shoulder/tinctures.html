<h2 id="1">1. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tincture" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential to support hormonal balance and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When formulated into a tincture, it may offer relief for individuals suffering from frozen shoulder by addressing underlying inflammatory and hormonal factors. The herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland and may help regulate cortisol levels, which can reduce inflammation and stiffness in the shoulder joint. While scientific evidence is limited, many users report improved mobility and reduced pain after consistent use of vitex tinctures.</p><p>It is often recommended as a complementary therapy alongside physical therapy and other conventional treatments for frozen shoulder.</p><h2 id="2">2. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa tincture" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is a herbal plant widely used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>Curcuma longa herbal tinctures are concentrated liquid extracts that can be easily absorbed by the body, making them a convenient option for managing symptoms of frozen shoulder. These tinctures contain curcumin, a bioactive compound known for its ability to reduce inflammation and pain. When applied topically or taken orally, curcuma longa tinctures may help alleviate the stiffness and discomfort associated with frozen shoulder.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these tinctures, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale tincture" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, making it a promising ingredient in herbal tinctures for frozen shoulder.</p><p>These tinctures typically combine powdered ginger root with alcohol to extract its active compounds, such as gingerols and shogaols, which are believed to reduce muscle stiffness and improve joint mobility. When applied topically, ginger tinctures may help alleviate the inflammation and discomfort associated with frozen shoulder by promoting circulation and reducing oxidative stress. Some studies suggest that ginger's ability to inhibit inflammatory pathways could support its use as a complementary therapy in managing shoulder stiffness.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginger tinctures, especially if you are on medication or have existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tincture" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John’s Wort, is a herbal plant often used in tincture form for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When used as a tincture, it may help alleviate the pain and stiffness associated with frozen shoulder by reducing inflammation in the affected joints and surrounding tissues. While some studies suggest that St. John’s Wort may have mild pain-relieving effects, its efficacy for frozen shoulder specifically is not well-established in clinical trials. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using hypericum perforatum tinctures, as they can interact with certain medications and may have side effects.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, frozen shoulder treatment typically involves a combination of physical therapy, heat application, and sometimes corticosteroid injections for more severe cases.</p><h2 id="5">5. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tincture" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal tinctures are commonly used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While they are primarily known for supporting the immune system, some individuals use echinacea tinctures to help alleviate the pain and stiffness associated with frozen shoulder. Although there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking echinacea to improved mobility in frozen shoulder cases, its anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to reducing inflammation in the affected joints. It is often recommended to use echinacea tinctures as part of a holistic approach alongside physical therapy and other conventional treatments.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating echinacea into a treatment plan for frozen shoulder.</p><h2 id="6">6. Arnica montana</h2><img alt="arnica montana tincture" src="/images/preparations/arnica-montana-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Arnica montana herbal tinctures are commonly used to support the treatment of frozen shoulder due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>These tinctures work by reducing swelling and pain in the affected shoulder joint, which can help improve mobility and range of motion. When applied topically to the skin, arnica montana may stimulate blood circulation and promote the body's natural healing processes. However, it is important to note that arnica should not be ingested and should be used with caution, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or those taking blood-thinning medications.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, arnica montana tinctures can be a valuable addition to a holistic approach for managing frozen shoulder symptoms.</p><h2 id="7">7. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tincture" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it can be applied externally to the affected area of the shoulder to help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. The active compounds in stinging nettle, such as flavonoids and alkaloids, may support tissue repair and improve circulation in the joint. However, it is important to dilute the tincture properly to avoid skin irritation, as the plant is known for its stinging effect.</p><p>While some individuals report relief from using stinging nettle tinctures, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into a treatment plan for frozen shoulder.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a potential candidate for use in tinctures for frozen shoulder.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, salvia officinalis can be applied topically to the affected area to help reduce pain and stiffness associated with this condition. The essential oils and compounds found in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, may contribute to its therapeutic effects by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage tinctures, as they may interact with certain medications or cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for frozen shoulder is limited, and it should be used as a complementary rather than a primary treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium tincture" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it may help reduce inflammation and pain associated with frozen shoulder by supporting the body's natural healing processes.
