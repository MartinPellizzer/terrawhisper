In traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic practices, licorice decoctions are often combined with other herbs to enhance their bronchodilatory and antispasmodic effects. While some studies suggest that licorice may have beneficial effects on respiratory symptoms, its use should be monitored due to potential side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances.</p><p>Overall, licorice root decoctions may offer supportive relief for wheezing, but they should be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider.</p><h2 id="6">6. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus decoction" src="/images/preparations/decoctions/vitex-agnus-castus-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential effects on the respiratory system.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from vitex agnus-castus may help alleviate symptoms of wheezing by reducing inflammation and promoting bronchodilation.
