<p>Cracked heels is a common condition characterized by dry, rough, and cracked skin on the heels, often caused by excessive dryness, exposure to harsh chemicals, or poor foot care.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective way to treat cracked heels, providing numerous benefits such as moisturizing, soothing, and protecting the skin.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like aloe vera, chamomile, and calendula are particularly effective in treating cracked heels due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to reduce inflammation and promote skin repair.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like aloe vera gel, chamomile tea baths, and calendula ointments can be used to treat cracked heels, while also providing additional benefits like relaxation and stress relief, and the ability to soothe and calm the skin.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes cracked heels?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of cracked heels are dry skin and excessive foot pressure, which can lead to the cracking of the skin on the heel.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include poor foot hygiene, using harsh soaps or exfoliants, and wearing tight or poorly fitting shoes, as these can further dry out and irritate the skin.</p>
<p>People with sedentary lifestyles or those who spend a lot of time on their feet without proper breaks may also be more prone to developing cracked heels due to increased pressure and friction.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals who work outdoors or in hot and dry environments may be more susceptible to cracked heels due to the constant exposure to dry air.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal cracked heels?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat cracked heels are Aloe vera, Tea tree oil, and Epsom salt, which have been used for their therapeutic properties to soothe and moisturize dry skin.</p>
<p>Aloe vera contains bioactive compounds such as aloin and aloe-emodin, which have anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce swelling and promote healing.</p>
<p>Tea tree oil, on the other hand, contains compounds like eucalyptol and linalool, which have antimicrobial properties that help to prevent infection and promote tissue repair.</p>
<p>By providing hydration and reducing inflammation, these herbs help to soften and repair dry, cracked skin on the heels.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat cracked heels?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat cracked heels are often soothing and moisturizing, such as topical infusions that help lock in moisture and promote skin regeneration.</p>
<p>Foot baths made with fragrant and nourishing decoctions can help soften the skin and reduce dryness, while compresses infused with emollient and protective compounds can provide a barrier against further cracking.</p>
<p>Herbal teas and infusions can be consumed internally to promote overall skin health and hydration, and some preparations can even help to strengthen the skin's natural barrier function.</p>
<p>In addition, poultices made with rich and emollient herbal extracts can provide intense hydration and nourishment to dry, cracked skin.</p>
