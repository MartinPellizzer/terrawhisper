<p>Dry eyes is a common condition where the eyes do not produce enough tears to lubricate and protect the eyes, leading to discomfort, blurred vision, and increased risk of eye infections.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat dry eyes, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as Aloe vera, Eyebright, and Calendula are particularly beneficial in treating dry eyes due to their anti-inflammatory and moisturizing properties, which help to soothe and calm the eyes.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as eye drops made from the extracts of herbs like Chamomile, Green tea, and Licorice root, as well as infusions of herbs like Marshmallow root and Ginger, can be used to treat dry eyes, providing relief from dryness, itchiness, and redness.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes dry eyes?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of dry eyes are a lack of tears or an imbalance in the composition of tears, which can be due to age-related changes, hormonal fluctuations, or certain medical conditions such as blepharitis or thyroid disorders.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include prolonged screen time, which reduces tear production and causes prolonged staring, as well as environmental factors like windy or dry weather, air conditioning or heating, and proximity to pollution sources.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with lifestyles that involve frequent computer use, reading, or watching TV for extended periods without taking breaks, or those who wear contact lenses, especially for prolonged periods, are more likely to develop dry eyes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people who take certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, or antidepressants, may also experience dry eyes as a side effect.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal dry eyes?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat dry eyes are rich in bioactive compounds that provide therapeutic benefits to soothe and moisturize the eyes.</p>
<p>Herbs like Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce redness and irritation associated with dry eyes.</p>
<p>These herbs also contain flavonoids and phenolic acids, such as quercetin and luteolin, which have antioxidant and soothing effects on the ocular surface.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis) contain mucilages that help to lubricate and protect the eyes, reducing dryness and discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat dry eyes?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat dry eyes are often consumed as teas, infusions, or decoctions that help to soothe and lubricate the eyes.</p>
<p>Drinking a warm tea made from a plant known for its anti-inflammatory properties can reduce redness and irritation, while an infusion rich in antioxidants can protect the eyes from damage.</p>
<p>A decoction from a plant with emollient properties can help to lock in moisture and promote healing, reducing the risk of further irritation.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations, such as those made from a plant rich in omega-3 fatty acids, can even help to reduce inflammation and promote the production of healthy tear fluid.</p>
