<h2 id="1">1. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tincture" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to address various health conditions, including skin irritations and inflammatory responses.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it may offer relief for itchy eyes by reducing inflammation and soothing irritation due to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. While some studies suggest that hypericum perforatum may have mild antihistaminic effects, its efficacy for itchy eyes specifically has not been extensively researched in clinical trials. It is important to note that using St. John's Wort tinctures for eye conditions should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it can interact with certain medications and may cause photosensitivity.</p><p>Additionally, it is not a substitute for medical treatment, and persistent eye itching should be evaluated by an eye care specialist to rule out more serious underlying conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita tincture" src="/images/preparations/chamomilla-recutita-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita herbal tinctures are commonly used to alleviate symptoms of itchy eyes due to their anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic properties.</p><p>These tinctures are typically made by steeping the dried flowers of the plant in alcohol, creating a concentrated form of the herb's active compounds. Chamomilla recutita contains compounds like chamazulene and bisabolol, which have been shown to reduce irritation and redness in the eyes.

However, it is important to note that arnica tinctures should not be applied directly to the eyes, as they can cause irritation or chemical burns. Instead, they are often diluted with a carrier oil or used in eye compresses under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a physician before using arnica for eye-related issues, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium tincture" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it may offer relief for itchy eyes by reducing irritation and redness.
