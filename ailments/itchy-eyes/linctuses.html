It can help soothe irritation and reduce redness caused by allergies or mild eye conditions. The soothing effects of chamomile are believed to stem from its high concentration of flavonoids and essential oils.</p><p>While generally considered safe for short-term use, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile linctus, especially for children or individuals with known allergies.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compounds in stinging nettle, such as histamine and formic acid, may contribute to its mild antihistaminic effects, which can help alleviate allergic reactions causing eye discomfort. However, it is important to note that while some individuals may find relief using urtica dioica linctus, it should not replace professional medical advice, especially for persistent or severe eye conditions.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health needs.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Arnica montana</h2><img alt="arnica montana linctuse" src="/images/preparations/arnica-montana-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Arnica montana herbal linctuses are traditionally used to alleviate symptoms of itchy eyes, often associated with allergic reactions or irritations.</p><p>These linctuses contain extracts of Arnica montana, a flowering plant known for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.

Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense linctuse" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it may help soothe irritated mucous membranes, potentially offering relief for itchy eyes by reducing inflammation and excess mucus production. However, it is important to note that equisetum arvense contains silica, which can be abrasive and may irritate the sensitive tissues of the eyes if not properly diluted. While some alternative medicine practitioners suggest its use for eye discomfort, there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for this specific application.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using equisetum arvense for itchy eyes, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="10">10.
