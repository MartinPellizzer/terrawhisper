The calming effects of chamomile may help reduce redness, irritation, and allergic reactions that contribute to eye itching. While not a substitute for medical treatment, chamomile syrups can serve as a natural complement to eye care routines.</p><p>However, individuals with allergies to plants in the daisy family should exercise caution before using chamomile-based products.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to note that while some individuals may find relief from using Hypericum perforatum syrup for itchy eyes, it should not replace professional medical advice, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before use, particularly if you are taking other medications, as St. John's Wort can interact with certain drugs.</p><h2 id="3">3.
