To prepare a decoction, the herbs are simmered in water for an extended period, allowing their active compounds to dissolve into the liquid. The warm decoction can be applied externally using a dropper to instill a few drops into the affected ear, helping to relieve discomfort and reduce infection risk.</p><p>While herbal decoctions may provide natural relief, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe ear pain to rule out more serious conditions.</p><div class="toc">

To prepare a decoction, the dried herb is simmered in water for several minutes, then strained and applied topically or used as a rinse. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific research supporting its efficacy for earache specifically, and caution should be exercised due to potential interactions with other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, consulting a healthcare professional is recommended before use, especially for conditions like ear infections where professional treatment may be necessary.</p><h2 id="2">2.
