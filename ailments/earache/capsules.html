Herbal capsules containing Hypericum perforatum are often marketed as natural alternatives to conventional pain relief medications, though their effectiveness for earache specifically requires further scientific validation. When considering its use for earache, it is important to consult a healthcare professional, as it may interact with other medications and is not a substitute for proper medical treatment.</p><p>Despite its historical use, the evidence supporting its efficacy for earache remains limited, and more research is needed to establish its role in this context.</p><h2 id="2">2.
