Ginger linctuses, which are liquid formulations containing powdered or extracted ginger, can be applied topically or ingested to alleviate discomfort. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginger linctuses for earache, especially if the condition persists or is accompanied by other symptoms.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully establish the efficacy and safety of ginger linctuses in treating earache.</p><h2 id="2">2.
