While they are not a cure for gallstones, some studies suggest that mucillages may aid in the gradual dissolution of small stones and support overall liver function. Herbal mucillages are often used as complementary therapies alongside conventional treatments, but they should not replace medical advice or procedures.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies for gallstones to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><div class="toc">
