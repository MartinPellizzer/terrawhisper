alt="herbal teas for gallstones">
<p>Herbal teas for gallstones are a type of natural remedy used to alleviate the symptoms and promote the healing of gallstones, which are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder.</p>
<p>These herbal teas offer numerous benefits, including reducing inflammation, improving digestion, and dissolving gallstones, making them a popular alternative to medical treatments.</p>
<p>Some of the most effective herbal teas for gallstones include dandelion root tea, milk thistle tea, and turmeric tea, which have anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce pain and inflammation associated with gallstones.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as peppermint tea, ginger tea, and licorice root tea can also help to relax the muscles and improve digestion, further aiding in the treatment of gallstones.</p>

<p>
According to "Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics", teas for gallstones may be beneficial due to their potential to contain curcumin, which can induce contraction of the human gall-bladder, thus possibly reducing gallbladder volume.
