While some studies suggest that certain herbs may aid in liver function and digestion, there is limited scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness in dissolving or preventing gallstones. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal lozenges, as they may interact with other medications or conditions.</p><p>For individuals with gallstones, medical interventions such as lithotripsy or surgery are generally more effective than herbal remedies alone.</p>
