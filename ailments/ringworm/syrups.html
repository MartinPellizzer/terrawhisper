These syrups may help reduce the symptoms of ringworm by inhibiting the growth of dermatophyte fungi. However, while some anecdotal evidence supports their use, scientific research on their efficacy for ringworm is limited.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Teucrium polium syrups as a treatment for ringworm, especially if other medical conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="2">2. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum syrup" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with treating mild depression, some studies suggest that its compounds may have antifungal properties that could be beneficial in treating fungal infections like ringworm. However, it is important to note that there is limited clinical evidence specifically supporting the use of Hypericum perforatum herbal syrups for ringworm, and its efficacy in this context remains largely anecdotal. When considering its use, individuals should consult with a healthcare provider, as it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>Despite its historical use, more research is needed to fully understand its potential role in the treatment of ringworm.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Ringworm is caused by dermatophyte fungi, and effective treatments typically involve antifungal medications such as topical creams or oral antifungals prescribed by a healthcare provider.

While aloe vera itself is not a direct antifungal agent, its moisturizing and antimicrobial properties may help alleviate symptoms associated with ringworm.
