<h2 id="1">1. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential antifungal properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its use in treating mild depression, some studies suggest that it may help in combating fungal infections like ringworm due to its active compounds such as hyperforin and hypericin. To use it for ringworm, the herb can be brewed into a tea and applied topically to the affected area, though it is important to note that internal consumption should be done with caution and under medical supervision. However, it is not a substitute for conventional antifungal treatments and should be used as a complementary therapy.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's wort, especially if you are on other medications, as it can interact with various drugs.</p><h2 id="2">2. Polium germander (Teucrium polium)</h2><img alt="teucrium polium tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/teucrium-polium-teas.jpg"/><p>Teucrium polium, also known as summer savory, is a herb that has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties.</p><p>Herbal teas made from Teucrium polium are believed to support the body's natural defenses against fungal infections, including ringworm. The active compounds in this herb, such as flavonoids and essential oils, may help inhibit the growth of dermatophytes, the fungi responsible for ringworm. While not a substitute for conventional treatments, some studies suggest that regular consumption of Teucrium polium tea may aid in reducing symptoms and promoting skin health.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for persistent or severe cases of ringworm.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Herbal teas made from dried stinging nettle leaves can be consumed internally to support the body's immune response against infections. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle tea as a treatment for ringworm, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, results may vary, and it should not replace conventional antifungal treatments prescribed by a doctor.</p><h2 id="4">4.

The active compound thymol in thyme has been shown to inhibit fungal growth, making it a potential natural remedy for skin infections. While thyme tea is generally safe to consume, it should not replace professional medical treatment for ringworm.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using thyme or any herbal remedy for persistent or severe fungal infections.</p><h2 id="5">5. English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/lavandula-angustifolia-teas.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its antifungal and soothing properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, lavender can help alleviate the symptoms of ringworm by reducing inflammation and itching associated with the fungal infection. While it is not a cure for ringworm, lavender tea may support the healing process when used as a complementary treatment alongside conventional antifungal medications. The essential oils in lavender, such as linalool and lavandulol, are believed to inhibit the growth of fungi like Trichophyton.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using lavender tea for ringworm, especially if the infection is severe or persistent.</p><h2 id="6">6. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal teas for its soothing and healing properties.</p><p>While aloe vera is not a primary treatment for ringworm, some people use it as a complementary remedy due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Herbal teas made from aloe vera may help alleviate skin irritation and promote healing in affected areas. However, it is important to note that ringworm is a fungal infection and requires antifungal treatment for effective resolution.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using aloe-based remedies for medical conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/echinacea-purpurea-teas.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support the immune system and may have antifungal properties.</p><p>While it is not a substitute for medical treatment, some studies suggest that echinacea may help reduce the duration and severity of fungal infections like ringworm. Herbal teas made from echinacea can be consumed internally to boost immunity, potentially aiding the body in fighting off fungal infections. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for those with allergies or taking medications.</p><p>For ringworm, topical application of echinacea-based products may complement other treatments, but should not replace professional medical advice.</p><h2 id="8">8. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/equisetum-arvense-teas.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its high silica content and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it may help support the body’s natural defenses against fungal infections like ringworm. While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking equisetum arvense tea to the treatment of ringworm, some practitioners believe it can aid in reducing inflammation and promoting skin healing. It is often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional antifungal treatments.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using equisetum arvense, as it may interact with certain medications and is not a substitute for medical treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn or St. Benedict's thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its antifungal properties, making it a potential remedy for ringworm.</p><p>This herb contains compounds such as flavonoids and essential oils that may help inhibit the growth of fungi like Trichophyton species, which cause ringworm. To use Cnicus benedictus for ringworm, it can be brewed into a tea and applied topically to the affected areas. While some anecdotal evidence supports its efficacy, more scientific research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and safety.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="10">10. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosmarinus-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a herb often used in herbal teas for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking rosemary tea to the treatment of ringworm, some traditional remedies suggest that its antifungal and antimicrobial compounds may help in managing fungal infections. Rosemary tea can be brewed by steeping dried leaves in hot water and consumed as a supportive measure alongside conventional treatments. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using rosemary or any herbal remedy for ringworm, as it may not be effective on its own.</p><p>Overall, rosemary herbal tea may offer some benefits but should not replace medical advice or prescribed antifungal treatments.</p>
