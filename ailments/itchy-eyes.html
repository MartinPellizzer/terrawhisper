<p>Itchy eyes is a common condition characterized by an itchy or burning sensation in the eyes, often caused by dryness, allergies, or irritants.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective way to treat itchy eyes, providing relief from the discomfort and promoting overall eye health.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Aloe vera, Calendula, and Eyebright are commonly used to treat itchy eyes, as they have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that calm the eyes and reduce redness.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye washes, lotions, and infusions made from herbs like Chamomile, Marshmallow root, and Nettle leaf are also beneficial in treating itchy eyes, as they can help to moisturize the eyes, reduce inflammation, and promote healing.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes itchy eyes?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of itchy eyes are allergies and irritants such as pollen, dust, and pet dander, which trigger an allergic reaction and cause the eyes to itch.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include dry eyes, due to inadequate tear production or evaporation, and exposure to harsh chemicals or makeup, which can irritate the eyes and cause itchiness.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing itchy eyes include working on a computer for extended periods, which can lead to dry eyes, and living in areas with high levels of pollution, which can trigger allergies and irritants.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who wear contact lenses may also experience itchy eyes due to the lenses or the cleaning solutions used to maintain them.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal itchy eyes?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat itchy eyes are often rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to soothe and calm irritated eyes.</p>
<p>Herbs such as eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) have been traditionally used to treat itchy eyes due to their ability to reduce inflammation and calm the nervous system through their sedative and anti-inflammatory actions.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in these herbs, including flavonoids and terpenoids, help to reduce inflammation and protect the delicate tissues of the eyes from further damage.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) have been used to treat itchy eyes due to their ability to soothe and protect the mucous membranes of the eyes through their anti-inflammatory and demulcent properties.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat itchy eyes?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat itchy eyes are a combination of soothing infusions, cooling decoctions, and calming teas that help to reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort.</p>
<p>A warm compress made from a herbal infusion can be applied to the eyes to alleviate the itching and redness, while a chilled tea can be used as a cold compress to reduce swelling.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations can be used as eye drops or washes, helping to calm and moisturize the eyes, while others can be consumed as teas to promote overall eye health.</p>
<p>Additionally, a herbal decoction can be used as a mask to gently exfoliate and soothe the skin around the eyes, providing long-lasting relief from itchy eyes.</p>
