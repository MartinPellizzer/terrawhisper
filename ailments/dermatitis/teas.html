<h2 id="1">1. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/matricaria-chamomilla-teas.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a popular herbal tea used for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>It is often recommended for individuals suffering from dermatitis due to its ability to calm irritated skin and reduce redness. Chamomile contains compounds like bisabolol and chamazulene, which have been shown to possess antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. When consumed as a tea, it can help support internal health, which in turn may benefit skin conditions.</p><p>Additionally, chamomile can be applied topically in the form of compresses or creams to provide direct relief from dermatitis symptoms.</p><h2 id="2">2. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a versatile herb that has been traditionally used in herbal teas to support skin health and alleviate symptoms of dermatitis.</p><p>The leaves of this plant contain anti-inflammatory compounds such as histamine, which can help reduce redness and irritation associated with skin conditions. When brewed into a tea, stinging nettle can soothe the skin and potentially ease itching and inflammation caused by dermatitis. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle tea, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p><p>While it may offer natural relief, it should not replace professional medical treatment for severe or chronic dermatitis cases.</p><h2 id="3">3. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas to support skin health and alleviate symptoms of dermatitis.</p><p>The gel derived from the aloe plant contains anti-inflammatory and moisturizing properties that can help reduce redness, itching, and irritation associated with various skin conditions. When consumed as a tea, aloe vera may aid in detoxifying the body and improving overall skin hydration from within. However, it is important to note that some individuals may experience digestive upset when consuming aloe vera tea, so it should be used with caution and in moderation.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, aloe barbadensis herbal tea can be a soothing addition to a holistic approach for managing dermatitis.</p><h2 id="4">4. Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, is increasingly being explored for its potential benefits in managing dermatitis due to its rich content of polyphenols, particularly catechins, which possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>These compounds may help reduce skin inflammation and redness commonly associated with conditions like atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis. Studies suggest that topical application of Camellia sinensis extracts can modulate immune responses and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, offering a natural alternative for skin soothing. Additionally, herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis are often consumed internally to support overall skin health by improving digestion and reducing systemic inflammation.</p><p>However, while promising, more clinical research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating dermatitis.</p><h2 id="5">5. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it may help alleviate symptoms of dermatitis by reducing redness, itching, and inflammation due to its active compounds such as hypericin and flavonoids. However, it is important to note that St. John's wort can interact with certain medications and may cause photosensitivity, so it should be used with caution. Despite its historical use, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for dermatitis is limited, and it is often recommended to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p><p>As an alternative or complementary therapy, hypericum perforatum tea may offer some relief for mild cases of dermatitis when used appropriately.</p><h2 id="6">6. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/salvia-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal teas to support skin health and alleviate symptoms of dermatitis.</p><p>The essential oils and bioactive compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can help reduce redness, itching, and infection associated with dermatitis. When consumed as a tea, sage may help regulate sebum production and soothe irritated skin from within. However, it is important to use sage tea cautiously, as it may cause skin irritation in some individuals when applied topically.</p><p>Overall, sage herbal tea can be a complementary remedy for managing dermatitis when used as part of a holistic skincare and wellness routine.</p><h2 id="7">7. English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/lavandula-angustifolia-teas.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is widely used in herbal teas for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a popular choice for individuals suffering from dermatitis.</p><p>The essential oils in lavender, such as linalool and linalyl acetate, have been shown to reduce skin irritation and redness, providing relief from symptoms associated with eczema and contact dermatitis. When consumed as a herbal tea, lavender can also help reduce stress, which is a known trigger for flare-ups of skin conditions. Its mild, calming aroma enhances the therapeutic experience, promoting relaxation and overall well-being.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using lavender tea, especially for those with known allergies or severe skin conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/chamomilla-recutita-teas.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is a popular herbal remedy used in the treatment of dermatitis due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>The essential oils in chamomile, particularly bisabolol and chamazulene, help reduce redness, itching, and irritation associated with skin conditions like eczema and contact dermatitis. Chamomile herbal teas can be applied topically as a compress or used in bathwater to soothe inflamed skin. Additionally, internal consumption of chamomile tea may support overall skin health by reducing systemic inflammation.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile, especially for individuals with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a herbal tea that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>It is particularly beneficial for individuals suffering from dermatitis due to its ability to soothe irritated skin and reduce redness. The tea contains high levels of vitamin C, which supports skin health and aids in the healing process.

When prepared as a herbal tea, equisetum arvense can be used externally as a compress or rinse to soothe inflammation and reduce redness associated with dermatitis.
