Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina bath" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-baths.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support skin health.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, rosehip oil or rosehip extract can provide soothing relief for individuals suffering from dermatitis due to its high concentration of essential fatty acids and antioxidants.
