<p>Glycyrrhiza glabra essential oils, derived from the roots of the licorice plant, have been traditionally used to treat high blood pressure due to their vasodilatory properties, which help to relax and dilate blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents present in these essential oils, including glycyrrhetinic acid and flavonoids, have been found to inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key player in blood pressure regulation, thereby contributing to their therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>By reducing the levels of stress hormones and promoting relaxation, Glycyrrhiza glabra essential oils help to alleviate high blood pressure and related symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia.</p>
