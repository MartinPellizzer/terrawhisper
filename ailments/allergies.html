<p>Allergies is an overreaction of the body's immune system to foreign substances, such as pollen, dust, or certain foods, leading to symptoms like itching, sneezing, and congestion.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have gained popularity in treating allergies due to their natural and non-invasive approach, which can help alleviate symptoms without the harsh side effects of conventional medications.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like Quercetin, found in plants like onions and garlic, have anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce swelling and itching, while herbs like Nettle and Butterbur have natural antihistamine effects that can relieve symptoms like congestion and sneezing.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as teas, tinctures, and supplements made from herbs like Stinging Nettle, Eyebright, and Goldenseal can be effective in treating allergies, with teas providing a soothing and calming effect, tinctures offering a concentrated dose of active compounds, and supplements providing a convenient and easily absorbable form of herbal medicine.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes allergies?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of allergies are genetic predisposition and environmental factors, specifically the presence of allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and pet dander, which trigger an overactive immune response.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include exposure to pollution and certain chemicals, as well as compromised gut health, which can lead to increased permeability and allow allergens to enter the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Lifestyles such as living in urban areas with high levels of air pollution, consuming a diet high in processed foods, and having a sedentary lifestyle can also increase the chances of developing allergies, as they can weaken the immune system and disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Additionally, a history of antibiotic use and a lack of breastfeeding in infancy have also been linked to an increased risk of developing allergies.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal allergies?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat allergies are rich in bioactive compounds and possess therapeutic actions that help alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Quercetin, found in herbs like Stinging Nettle and Osha, has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce histamine release and calm allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, herbs like Butterbur and Eyebright contain compounds like sesquiterpenes and flavonoids, which exhibit antihistamine and antioxidant effects, respectively, to soothe irritated tissues and promote healing.</p>
<p>These herbal remedies also support the body's natural detoxification processes, helping to remove allergenic substances and reduce overall sensitivity.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat allergies?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat allergies are diverse and can be consumed as teas, infusions, or tinctures, such as those made from plants known to reduce inflammation and alleviate congestion.</p>
<p>These preparations can also be found in the form of cold compresses or poultices, which are applied topically to relieve itchy skin and sinuses.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations are used to boost the body's natural defenses, while others are used to thin mucus and promote drainage, making it easier to breathe.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations can be used as a natural antihistamine, helping to alleviate symptoms such as itching and swelling.</p>
