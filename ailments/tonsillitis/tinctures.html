While scientific evidence on their effectiveness for tonsillitis is limited, some studies suggest that echinacea may help shorten the duration of colds and reduce the risk of infections. Many people use echinacea tinctures as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, though it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with allergies or on medication.</p><p>Overall, echinacea purpurea tinctures are considered a safe option for mild respiratory infections, but their role in treating tonsillitis remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.</p><h2 id="3">3.

However, long-term use of licorice tinctures should be avoided due to potential side effects like increased blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance.</p><p>When used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, glycyrrhiza glabra tinctures can be a safe and effective complementary therapy for managing tonsillitis.</p><h2 id="5">5.
