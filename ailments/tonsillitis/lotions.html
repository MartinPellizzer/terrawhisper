It is important to note that herbal lotions should not replace prescribed medical treatments for severe tonsillitis, and individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using them.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, the safety and efficacy of Echinacea purpurea lotions can vary, and potential allergic reactions or interactions with other medications should be considered.</p><h2 id="9">9.
