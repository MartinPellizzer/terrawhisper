Some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of mucillages may also reduce oxidative stress, a factor linked to bone degradation. Additionally, certain mucillages have been shown to stimulate bone-forming cells, promoting the growth of new bone tissue.</p><p>Incorporating these natural substances into a balanced diet may thus contribute to maintaining strong and healthy bones over time.</p>
