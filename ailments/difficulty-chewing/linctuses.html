<h2 id="1">1. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra linctuse" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal linctuses to alleviate difficulty chewing due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These linctuses often contain a concentrated form of glycyrrhizin, which helps reduce irritation and inflammation in the oral cavity, making it easier to chew and swallow.

Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale linctuse" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, is often used in herbal linctuses to address difficulty chewing, as it possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that can help reduce mouth pain and swelling.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated form of ginger extract, which can be soothing to irritated oral tissues and improve overall comfort during chewing.

Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to alleviate difficulty in chewing.</p><p>The active compound in black pepper, piperine, may help improve oral sensitivity and stimulate saliva production, making it easier to chew food.
