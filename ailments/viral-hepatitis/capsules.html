These capsules are typically standardized to ensure consistent levels of active compounds like gingerol and shogaol, which are believed to contribute to their therapeutic effects. While more clinical research is needed, some preliminary evidence indicates that ginger may support liver function and enhance the body’s natural detoxification processes.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using zingiber officinale capsules, especially for those with chronic liver conditions or on medication.</p><h2 id="5">5. False leaf (Phyllanthus amarus)</h2><img alt="phyllanthus amarus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/phyllanthus-amarus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Phyllanthus amarus, commonly known as the stonebreaker plant, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential liver-protecting properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Phyllanthus amarus are often marketed as natural remedies for viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C, due to their reported antiviral and hepatoprotective effects. Studies suggest that the active compounds in Phyllanthus amarus may help reduce viral load and support liver function by inhibiting viral replication and reducing inflammation. However, while some preliminary research shows promise, more clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for treating hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Phyllanthus amarus, especially when combined with conventional treatments.</p><h2 id="6">6. Sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua)</h2><img alt="artemisia annua capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/artemisia-annua-capsules.jpg"/><p>Artemisia annua, a herb traditionally used in Chinese medicine, has gained attention for its potential role in the treatment of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C. The active compound in artemisia annua, artemisinin, is known for its antiparasitic properties, but recent research suggests it may also exhibit antiviral effects against hepatitis viruses.</p><p>Some studies indicate that artemisia annua herbal capsules may help reduce liver inflammation and improve liver function in patients with hepatitis. However, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety as a complementary therapy for viral hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using artemisia annua, especially for individuals with existing liver conditions or those on other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Puncture vine (Tribulus terrestris)</h2><img alt="tribulus terrestris capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/tribulus-terrestris-capsules.jpg"/><p>Tribulus terrestris herbal capsules are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential health benefits, including support for liver function and detoxification.</p><p>While some studies suggest that Tribulus terrestris may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is currently limited scientific evidence specifically supporting its use in treating viral hepatitis. It is important to note that herbal supplements should not replace conventional medical treatments for hepatitis, and their safety and efficacy can vary. Individuals considering Tribulus terrestris for hepatitis should consult with a healthcare professional to ensure it is appropriate for their condition.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is crucial to purchase from reputable sources to avoid contamination or incorrect labeling.</p><h2 id="8">8. Negundo vitex (Vitex negundo)</h2><img alt="vitex negundo capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-negundo-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex negundo, commonly known as the common vitex or chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hepatoprotective properties.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Vitex negundo are being explored as a complementary therapy for viral hepatitis, due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Preliminary studies suggest that the plant may help support liver function and reduce oxidative stress, which are key factors in hepatitis progression. However, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in treating viral hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or those on medication.</p><h2 id="9">9. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal supplement traditionally used for its antidepressant properties, but recent studies suggest it may also have potential benefits in supporting liver health.</p><p>While it is not a cure for viral hepatitis, some research indicates that its active compounds, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may possess antiviral and hepatoprotective effects.
