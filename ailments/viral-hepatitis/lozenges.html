However, while preliminary research is promising, more clinical trials are needed to establish their efficacy and safety in treating viral hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using zingiber officinale lozenges as part of a treatment regimen.</p><h2 id="5">5. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra herbal lozenges are formulated to support the treatment of viral hepatitis by potentially reducing inflammation in the liver and inhibiting viral replication. These lozenges contain glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its ability to interfere with the replication of certain viruses, including hepatitis B and C. While they are not a substitute for conventional medical treatment, they may offer complementary benefits in managing symptoms and supporting liver health.</p><p>However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="6">6. Coptis chinensis</h2><img alt="coptis chinensis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/coptis-chinensis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Coptis chinensis herbal lozenges are traditional Chinese medicine formulations derived from the dried root of the Coptis chinensis plant, known for their potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These lozenges are commonly used to support liver health and may aid in the management of viral hepatitis by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver. While they are not a substitute for conventional antiviral treatments, some studies suggest that the active compound berberine in Coptis chinensis may help improve liver function and reduce viral load in certain cases. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these lozenges, as they may interact with other medications and are not approved as a standalone treatment for hepatitis.</p><p>Overall, Coptis chinensis lozenges are often used as a complementary therapy to support overall liver health in individuals with viral hepatitis.</p><h2 id="7">7. Vitex negundo</h2><img alt="vitex negundo lozenge" src="/images/preparations/vitex-negundo-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Vitex negundo herbal lozenges are traditionally used in herbal medicine to support liver health and aid in the management of viral hepatitis.</p><p>These lozenges contain extracts from the Vitex negundo plant, which is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help protect liver cells from viral damage.

The lozenges are often formulated to be easily absorbed and may help alleviate symptoms such as fatigue and digestive discomfort associated with hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with chronic liver conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea lozenge" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal lozenges are commonly used as a complementary therapy to support the immune system, though their efficacy for viral hepatitis remains under investigation.</p><p>While echinacea is traditionally valued for its potential to reduce the duration and severity of colds, scientific evidence regarding its impact on viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis A, B, or C, is limited and inconclusive. Some preliminary studies suggest that echinacea may have antiviral properties that could theoretically inhibit viral replication, but more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects. Due to the lack of robust research, health authorities generally do not recommend echinacea as a primary treatment for viral hepatitis.</p><p>Individuals considering echinacea lozenges for hepatitis should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure safety and appropriateness, especially if they are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its antidepressant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>While it is primarily recognized for its role in treating mild to moderate depression, recent research suggests that its active compounds, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may also exhibit antiviral effects. Some studies indicate that Hypericum perforatum herbal lozenges could potentially support the immune system and reduce the replication of certain viruses, including those associated with viral hepatitis. However, it is important to note that there is currently limited clinical evidence specifically supporting its efficacy in treating viral hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it may interact with other medications and treatments.</p><h2 id="10">10.
