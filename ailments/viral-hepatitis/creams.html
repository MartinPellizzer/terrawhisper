While some studies suggest that silymarin may help support liver function and reduce oxidative stress in individuals with hepatitis, more clinical evidence is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating viral hepatitis specifically. Herbal creams containing silybum marianum are often marketed as complementary therapies to conventional treatments, but they should not replace medical advice or prescribed medications.</p><p>As with any herbal product, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using silybum marianum creams, especially for individuals with existing liver conditions or those undergoing medical treatment.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra cream" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-creams.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, making it a potential candidate for the treatment of viral hepatitis.</p><p>Studies suggest that glycyrrhizin, the main active compound in licorice root, may inhibit the replication of hepatitis B and C viruses by interfering with their life cycle.
