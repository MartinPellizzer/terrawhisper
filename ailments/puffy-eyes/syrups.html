The syrup is often believed to help reduce fluid retention and inflammation around the eye area, which can contribute to puffiness. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically supporting its use for puffy eyes is limited, and results may vary among individuals.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/vitex-agnus-castus-syrups.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is often used in herbal syrups to address various hormonal imbalances, including those that may contribute to puffy eyes.</p><p>These syrups are believed to support the body's natural regulatory processes, potentially reducing fluid retention and inflammation around the eye area.

Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/echinacea-purpurea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal syrups are traditionally used to support immune health, but they are not specifically formulated for puffy eyes.</p><p>While some people may use echinacea syrups as a natural remedy for eye swelling, there is limited scientific evidence to support its effectiveness for this purpose. Puffy eyes are often caused by factors such as allergies, lack of sleep, or fluid retention, and echinacea may not address these underlying causes. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea for eye-related concerns, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><p>For persistent or severe puffiness, more targeted treatments or lifestyle adjustments may be necessary.</p>
