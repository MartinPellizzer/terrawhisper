When applied as a cold compress, chamomile tea can provide a cooling effect that alleviates puffiness and redness. It is also believed to promote relaxation, which can indirectly reduce eye strain and swelling.</p><p>For best results, it is recommended to use freshly brewed chamomile tea, cooled to a comfortable temperature, and apply it to the eyes with a clean cloth.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Some people use cold-brewed Camellia sinensis tea as a compress to soothe tired, puffy eyes, leveraging its mild astringent properties. The caffeine in these teas can temporarily constrict blood vessels, which may help reduce the appearance of puffiness.</p><p>While not a substitute for medical treatments, Camellia sinensis herbal teas are often recommended as a natural, gentle option for those seeking mild relief from eye puffiness.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The tea contains compounds such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may help soothe inflammation and improve circulation. Some people use stinging nettle tea as a natural remedy for under-eye swelling, either by drinking it or applying it topically as a compress.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have allergies or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="5">5.

When consumed as a calming herbal tea, vitex may help alleviate the appearance of puffiness by reducing inflammation and improving lymphatic drainage. Its mild, slightly floral flavor makes it a pleasant and soothing option for daily consumption.</p><p>While it is generally considered safe, individuals with hormonal conditions should consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into their routine.</p><h2 id="10">10.
