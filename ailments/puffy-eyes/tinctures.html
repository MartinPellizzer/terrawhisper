However, it is important to dilute the tincture properly before use, as it can be quite potent and may cause irritation if used undiluted.</p><p>While some individuals report positive results with Cnicus benedictus tinctures for puffy eyes, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into a skincare or wellness routine.</p><h2 id="8">8. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tincture" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, is also used to create herbal tinctures that are popular for their potential benefits in reducing puffy eyes.</p><p>These tinctures are typically made by steeping the dried leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds such as caffeine, theanine, and polyphenols to be extracted.

Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tincture" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal tinctures are often used for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties, which may help reduce puffiness around the eyes.</p><p>While primarily known for supporting immune health, some people use echinacea tinctures topically or orally to alleviate mild swelling and redness associated with puffy eyes. However, it's important to note that there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking echinacea to the reduction of under-eye puffiness. When using echinacea for this purpose, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have allergies or are taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses can vary, and consistency in use may be necessary to observe any potential benefits.</p>
