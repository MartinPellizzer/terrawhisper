To prepare the bath, a handful of dried St. John's Wort is steeped in boiling water for several hours, then cooled before being used as a compress or added to a basin of warm water.</p><p>While generally safe for topical use, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort, especially if you are taking medications, as it can interact with certain drugs.</p><h2 id="6">6. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia bath" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-baths.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal baths for its soothing and calming properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, lavender essential oil can help reduce inflammation and promote relaxation, making it particularly beneficial for puffy eyes.

The mild, soothing properties of yarrow make it suitable for sensitive skin, offering a gentle yet effective remedy for tired, puffy eyes.</p><p>Regular use of yarrow-infused baths may promote overall skin health and provide a calming effect, supporting natural healing processes.</p><h2 id="8">8. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense bath" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-baths.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its high concentration of silica, which is believed to support skin health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, horsetail can help soothe and reduce puffiness around the eyes by improving circulation and promoting the drainage of excess fluids.

To use it effectively, simply steep a handful of dried vitex in hot water for several hours, then add it to a warm bath and soak for 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>Regular use of vitex agnus-castus baths may help improve overall eye health and reduce the appearance of under-eye bags.</p><h2 id="10">10. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum bath" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-baths.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy often used in baths to address puffy eyes due to its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, the compound silymarin in milk thistle may help reduce swelling and irritation around the eyes by improving circulation and supporting liver function, which plays a key role in toxin elimination. A warm milk thistle bath can soothe tired eyes and promote relaxation, making it a gentle alternative to topical treatments for under-eye puffiness. However, it is important to ensure the bath is not too hot and to consult a healthcare provider before using it, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing health conditions.</p><p>Overall, silybum marianum herbal baths offer a natural and calming approach to reducing eye puffiness and supporting overall wellness.</p>
