They are often preferred by individuals seeking alternative or complementary therapies due to their generally mild side effect profile compared to pharmaceutical drugs. Herbal syrups may help support nerve healing and alleviate symptoms like tingling, numbness, and burning sensations associated with neuritis.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these syrups, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><div class="toc">
