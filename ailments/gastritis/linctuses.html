The soothing and protective effects of silybum marianum linctuses may help reduce inflammation in the stomach lining and promote the healing of gastritis-related ulcers. Additionally, the herb is believed to enhance the production of protective mucus in the gastrointestinal tract, offering relief from irritation and discomfort.</p><p>However, while generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these linctuses, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The essential oils in cumin, such as limonene and terpinene, are believed to have antispasmodic and carminative properties that can ease stomach discomfort. While more clinical research is needed, some studies suggest that cumin may support gut health and reduce acid production.</p><p>As a natural remedy, cumin-based linctuses can be a complementary option for managing mild gastritis symptoms under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="4">4. Althaea officinalis</h2><img alt="althaea officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/althaea-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Althaea officinalis, commonly known as marshmallow root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties, particularly in the form of linctuses for gastritis.</p><p>The mucilage present in the plant acts as a protective barrier over the lining of the stomach, helping to reduce irritation and inflammation. These linctuses are often prepared by steeping the root in water or honey, creating a thick, viscous substance that coats the stomach lining. Due to its demulcent properties, Althaea officinalis linctus can help alleviate symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion, and stomach discomfort associated with gastritis.</p><p>While it is generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if other underlying conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="5">5. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla linctuse" src="/images/preparations/matricaria-chamomilla-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is often used in herbal linctuses for the management of gastritis due to its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated extract of chamomile flowers, which are rich in flavonoids and essential oils that help reduce stomach irritation and inflammation. The calming effects of chamomile can aid in relieving symptoms such as heartburn, bloating, and excess acid production associated with gastritis. When used as a natural remedy, chamomile linctuses offer a gentle alternative to conventional medications, particularly for those seeking non-pharmacological treatment options.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile linctuses, especially if other medical conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="6">6. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa linctuse" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>When formulated into linctuses, these herbal preparations can provide soothing relief for individuals suffering from gastritis by reducing inflammation in the stomach lining. The active compound, curcumin, helps to inhibit the production of harmful stomach acids and promotes the healing of irritated tissues. Additionally, curcuma longa linctuses may help alleviate symptoms such as indigestion, nausea, and abdominal discomfort associated with gastritis.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using turmeric-based remedies, especially if you are on medication or have other underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica linctuse" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it can help alleviate the symptoms of gastritis by reducing stomach inflammation and neutralizing excess acid.

This herbal linctus is often recommended for individuals with chronic gastritis due to its gentle yet effective action on the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you are on other medications or have known allergies.</p><h2 id="8">8. Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare linctuse" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal linctuses for the treatment of gastritis due to its carminative and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The essential oils in fennel, particularly anethol and fenchone, help to soothe the gastrointestinal tract and reduce inflammation in the stomach lining. Herbal linctuses containing fennel are often prepared with a base of honey or glycerin, making them easy to swallow and effective in easing symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. These preparations are valued for their mild and natural approach to managing gastritis without the side effects associated with synthetic medications.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using fennel linctuses, especially for individuals with known allergies or chronic health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra linctuse" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties, making it a popular ingredient in linctuses for gastritis.</p><p>These linctuses work by forming a protective barrier over the stomach lining, helping to reduce irritation and inflammation caused by excess acid. The active compounds in licorice, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects that can alleviate symptoms like heartburn and indigestion. However, prolonged use of licorice-based linctuses may lead to side effects such as hypertension due to the compound's mineralocorticoid-like activity.</p><p>As a result, it is often recommended to use licorice root preparations under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="10">10. Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in managing gastritis.</p><p>The active compound in black pepper, piperine, may help reduce inflammation in the stomach lining and enhance the absorption of other medicinal compounds. When incorporated into herbal linctuses, black pepper can provide a soothing effect on the digestive tract, alleviating symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. These linctuses are often prepared with mild, soothing ingredients to ensure they are gentle on the stomach while delivering the therapeutic properties of black pepper.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using black pepper linctuses, as they may interact with other medications or exacerbate certain conditions.</p>
