When applied topically, ginger-based lotions may provide a warming effect that can alleviate discomfort associated with gastritis. While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, they may complement conventional therapies by offering natural relief.</p><p>However, individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test before using these lotions to avoid potential irritation.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While some studies suggest that silymarin, the active compound in milk thistle, may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, the effectiveness of topical lotions for internal conditions like gastritis remains limited. As a result, it is generally recommended to consult a healthcare professional before using silybum marianum lotions for gastritis, as they may not provide sufficient systemic benefits.</p><p>Nonetheless, some individuals may find the soothing properties of these lotions helpful for localized discomfort or as part of a holistic approach to digestive wellness.</p><h2 id="3">3.
