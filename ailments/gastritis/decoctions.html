These decoctions may help reduce gastric inflammation and protect the stomach lining by inhibiting the production of harmful stomach acid. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using turmeric decoctions, as they may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, more clinical research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating gastritis.</p><h2 id="2">2. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra decoction" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in treating gastritis.</p><p>Its decoctions, made by boiling the root in water, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that can help reduce stomach irritation and inflammation. The active compounds in licorice, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, may help protect the gastric mucosa and promote the healing of the stomach lining. However, prolonged use of licorice root decoctions can lead to side effects like hypertension and electrolyte imbalances due to its effect on the adrenal glands.</p><p>Therefore, it is often recommended to use licorice root under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale decoction" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties, including its ability to soothe gastritis.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from fresh or dried ginger root are often prepared by simmering the rhizome in water to extract its active compounds, such as gingerol and shogaol. These decoctions are believed to reduce inflammation in the stomach lining and alleviate symptoms like nausea, bloating, and heartburn associated with gastritis.

While some studies suggest that milk thistle may aid in managing gastritis, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in this context.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using Silybum marianum decoctions for gastritis.</p><h2 id="5">5. Cuminum cyminum</h2><img alt="cuminum cyminum decoction" src="/images/preparations/cuminum-cyminum-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Cuminum cyminum, commonly known as cumin, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in treating gastritis.</p><p>The seeds of cumin contain essential oils, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds that may help reduce inflammation and soothe the stomach lining.

Chamomile decoctions help reduce gastric irritation by calming the digestive tract and decreasing acid secretion, making them beneficial for individuals with gastritis. Its mild sedative effects also contribute to overall digestive wellness by reducing stress-related symptoms that may exacerbate gastritis.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile, especially for those with allergies or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Althaea officinalis</h2><img alt="althaea officinalis decoction" src="/images/preparations/althaea-officinalis-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Althaea officinalis, commonly known as marshmallow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties, particularly in the treatment of gastritis.</p><p>The roots and leaves of this plant contain mucilage, which forms a protective layer over the stomach lining, helping to reduce inflammation and irritation. Herbal decoctions made from Althaea officinalis are often prepared by simmering the dried root in water, allowing the mucilage to dissolve and create a thick, gel-like substance. These decoctions are believed to alleviate symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and abdominal discomfort associated with gastritis.</p><p>Due to its gentle nature, Althaea officinalis is considered a safe herbal remedy for long-term use in managing chronic gastritis.</p><h2 id="10">10.
