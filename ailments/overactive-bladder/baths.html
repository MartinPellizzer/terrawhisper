The warmth of the water combined with the therapeutic properties of these herbs can help relax the pelvic muscles and promote a sense of overall well-being. While herbal baths are not a cure for overactive bladder, they can serve as a complementary therapy to support other treatments and improve quality of life.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating herbal baths into a treatment plan, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions.</p><div class="toc">

The essential oils in lemongrass are believed to promote relaxation and improve urinary control by reducing muscle tension. Studies suggest that the aromatic compounds in lemongrass may have a positive effect on pelvic floor muscles, enhancing bladder function.</p><p>While herbal baths can be a complementary therapy, they should be used alongside medical advice and not as a replacement for professional treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9.
