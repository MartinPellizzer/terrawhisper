The anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties of chamomile may help alleviate muscle tension in the throat and mouth, potentially improving articulation. However, it is important to note that chamomile should not be considered a substitute for professional speech therapy or medical treatment.</p><p>Individuals experiencing persistent speech difficulties should consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate course of action.</p><h2 id="10">10.
