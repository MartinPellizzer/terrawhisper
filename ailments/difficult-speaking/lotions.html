Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lotion" src="/images/preparations/lotions/zingiber-officinale-lotions.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, making it a popular ingredient in herbal lotions.</p><p>These lotions are often formulated to alleviate discomfort associated with difficult speaking, such as throat irritation or hoarseness, by reducing inflammation and promoting healing.
