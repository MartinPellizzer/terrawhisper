Satureja hortensis</h2><img alt="satureja hortensis decoction" src="/images/preparations/satureja-hortensis-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Satureja hortensis, commonly known as summer savory, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its aromatic and digestive properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from this plant can help alleviate bad breath by promoting oral hygiene and reducing bacterial buildup in the mouth.
