Adding these herbs to a warm bath allows the steam to release their essential oils, which can be inhaled and provide a refreshing effect on the respiratory system. Regular use of herbal baths may also support overall digestion and reduce systemic factors that contribute to bad breath.</p><p>While herbal baths should not replace proper dental care, they can serve as a complementary method to enhance breath freshness naturally.</p>
