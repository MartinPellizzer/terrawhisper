While they may provide some relief for minor chest discomfort or muscle tension, they are not a substitute for medical treatment in cases of severe or persistent heart-related symptoms. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal creams, especially if you have a known heart condition or are taking medications.</p><p>These products can be a complementary therapy when used alongside conventional medical care, but they should never replace it.</p><div class="toc">

These creams are typically applied topically to areas of the body associated with heart pain, such as the chest or shoulders, to promote circulation and alleviate discomfort.
