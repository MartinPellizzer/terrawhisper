<p>Tinnitus is a common condition characterized by ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in the ears when there is no external source, often affecting a person's quality of life.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have gained popularity in treating tinnitus due to their potential to alleviate symptoms, improve sleep, and reduce stress, all of which can exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as Ginkgo biloba, known for its antioxidant properties, and St. John's Wort, which helps to reduce inflammation, are often used to treat tinnitus.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like ear drops infused with herbs like garlic, mullein, and lavender oil can help to reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and soothe the ear canal, while herbal teas containing herbs like chamomile, passionflower, and valerian root can promote relaxation and reduce stress.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes tinnitus?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of tinnitus are damage to the hair cells in the inner ear or problems with the auditory nerve, which can lead to the perception of ringing or other sounds.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include earwax buildup, certain medications, such as antibiotics and aspirin, and exposure to loud noises, which can all contribute to tinnitus by further damaging the hair cells or disrupting normal ear function.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing tinnitus include working in noisy environments, using headphones at high volumes, and smoking, as these can all cause further damage to the delicate structures in the ear.</p>
<p>Additionally, age-related hearing loss and head or neck injuries can also contribute to tinnitus by disrupting the normal functioning of the ear and auditory nerve.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal tinnitus?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat tinnitus are those with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, such as Ginkgo biloba, which has been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the auditory system.</p>
<p>Licorice root, rich in glycyrrhizin, has been found to modulate the activity of enzymes involved in the regulation of auditory function, potentially alleviating tinnitus symptoms.</p>
<p>The bioactive compound curcumin, found in turmeric, has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects that may help reduce the severity of tinnitus.</p>
<p>Additionally, the flavonoids present in St. John's Wort, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may help to reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress associated with tinnitus.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat tinnitus?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat tinnitus are teas, infusions, and decoctions that are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, such as ear drops made from extracts of flowers and leaves that promote blood flow and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations are also used as ear oils, while others are consumed as teas to soothe the nervous system and calm the mind.</p>
<p>Herbal infusions of roots and barks are also used to treat tinnitus, as they have been shown to have a balancing effect on the body's energy and reduce stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations are used as a warm compress to apply heat and relieve tension in the ears and surrounding areas.</p>
