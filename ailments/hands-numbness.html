alt="herbs for numbness in hands">
<p>Numbness in hands is a common condition characterized by a lack of sensation or feeling in the hands, often caused by nerve damage, poor circulation, or certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat numbness in hands, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Ginkgo Biloba, Ginger, and Turmeric have anti-inflammatory properties that help to improve blood flow and reduce nerve damage, while others like Ashwagandha, Valerian, and Passionflower have antioxidant properties that help to soothe and calm the nervous system.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as teas, tinctures, and topical creams made from herbs like St. John's Wort, Epsom Salt, and Arnica can be applied directly to the affected area or consumed internally to promote healing and reduce numbness, offering a gentle and non-invasive approach to treatment.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes numbness in hands?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of numbness in hands are often related to neurological disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and multiple sclerosis, which can compress or damage nerves responsible for sensation and motor control.</p>
<p>Secondary causes may include vitamin deficiencies, particularly B12 deficiency, which can affect nerve function, as well as certain medications like chemotherapy and corticosteroids, which can have neurotoxic effects.</p>
<p>Additionally, repetitive strain injuries from activities like typing or playing musical instruments can also contribute to numbness in hands.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that involve prolonged periods of sitting, smoking, or excessive caffeine consumption can increase the risk of developing numbness in hands due to reduced blood flow and nerve compression.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal numbness in hands?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat numbness in hands are Ginkgo biloba and St. John's Wort, which have been traditionally used to improve blood circulation and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba's therapeutic action includes increasing nitric oxide production, which helps to dilate blood vessels and improve oxygen delivery to the hands.</p>
<p>St. John's Wort contains hyperforin, a bioactive compound that has anti-inflammatory properties and helps to reduce neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>The combination of these herbs can help to alleviate numbness in the hands by promoting blood flow and reducing inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat numbness in hands?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat numbness in hands are often consumed as teas or infusions, which are rich in antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Infusions of certain flowering plants are said to improve blood circulation and reduce numbness, while teas made from the roots of specific plants are believed to have a warming effect on the hands.</p>
<p>Decoctions of certain barks are also used to stimulate nerve regeneration and reduce numbness, while infusions of leafy greens are thought to have a relaxing effect on the nervous system.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal tonics and infusions are used to improve nerve function and reduce numbness in the hands.</p>
