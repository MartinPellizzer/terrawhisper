<p>Baldness is a medical condition characterized by excessive hair loss from the scalp, often due to genetics, hormonal imbalances, or aging.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have gained popularity in treating baldness due to their potential to promote hair growth, improve scalp health, and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Herbs like saw palmetto, biotin-rich ginseng, and rosemary have been used to treat baldness, as they stimulate blood flow to the scalp, promote hair growth, and reduce the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair loss.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as saw palmetto oil, biotin supplements, and rosemary essential oil have been used to treat baldness, as they can be easily absorbed into the skin, promoting hair growth and reducing inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes baldness?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of baldness are primarily genetic and hormonal imbalances, specifically the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which leads to hair follicle shrinkage and eventual hair loss.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of baldness include nutritional deficiencies, particularly low levels of iron and zinc, as well as chronic stress, which can lead to an overactive thyroid gland and an increase in DHT production.</p>
<p>Certain lifestyles, such as smoking and excessive heat styling, can also contribute to hair loss, as they damage the hair follicles and disrupt the hair growth cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, a diet high in processed foods and low in omega-3 fatty acids can also increase the risk of baldness, as it can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress that damage the hair follicles.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal baldness?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat baldness are aloe vera, saw palmetto, and ginkgo biloba, which have been traditionally used to promote hair growth and prevent hair loss.</p>
<p>Aloe vera exhibits therapeutic actions such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to soothe an itchy scalp and protect hair follicles from damage.</p>
<p>Saw palmetto, on the other hand, contains bioactive compounds like beta-sitosterol and ursolic acid, which may inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair loss.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba, rich in flavonoids and terpenoids, helps improve blood circulation to the scalp, promoting a healthy environment for hair growth.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat baldness?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat baldness are consumed as teas, infusions, and decoctions, which are believed to stimulate hair growth and improve scalp health.</p>
<p>Some of these preparations are applied topically as lotions, balms, and oils to nourish the hair follicles and promote regrowth.</p>
<p>Others, such as infusions and tinctures, are used as dietary supplements to provide essential nutrients and minerals that support hair growth.</p>
<p>These preparations are often used in combination with massage and scalp stimulation techniques to enhance their effectiveness and promote overall hair health.</p>
