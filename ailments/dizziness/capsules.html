These capsules are often recommended for individuals experiencing dizziness related to poor circulation or age-related cognitive decline. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting ginkgo biloba, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness for dizziness.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Some studies suggest that rosemary may enhance mental clarity and reduce stress, which are common contributors to episodes of dizziness. While more research is needed to confirm its efficacy, many users report a sense of balance and relief after taking rosemary capsules.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7.
