<h2 id="1">1. Ginkgo biloba</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba capsule" src="/images/preparations/ginkgo-biloba-capsules.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal capsules are commonly used to support cognitive function and improve blood circulation, which may help alleviate symptoms of dizziness.</p><p>The herb contains flavonoids and terpenoids that are believed to enhance oxygen flow to the brain and reduce oxidative stress. Some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of vertigo and other forms of dizziness. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>While generally considered safe, ginkgo biloba may interact with certain drugs and should be used with caution.</p><h2 id="2">2. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms related to women's health.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Vitex agnus-castus are often used to address dizziness, particularly when it is linked to hormonal fluctuations such as those experienced during menstruation, menopause, or polycystic ovary syndrome. The herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland, which may help regulate the production of hormones like prolactin and estrogen, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of dizziness episodes. While some studies suggest that Vitex agnus-castus may help with symptoms of menopausal dizziness, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and mechanisms.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Panax ginseng</h2><img alt="panax ginseng capsule" src="/images/preparations/panax-ginseng-capsules.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng herbal capsules are commonly used to support cognitive function and alleviate symptoms such as dizziness by enhancing blood circulation and reducing stress.</p><p>This adaptogenic herb is believed to regulate the body's response to stress, which can contribute to feelings of dizziness in some individuals. The active compounds in Panax ginseng, such as ginsenosides, may help improve mental clarity and balance, potentially reducing episodes of lightheadedness. While some studies suggest its efficacy in managing mild dizziness, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>As with any supplement, the quality and dosage of Panax ginseng capsules can significantly affect their effectiveness and safety.</p><h2 id="4">4. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy often used in the form of capsules to help alleviate symptoms such as dizziness.</p><p>This plant contains compounds like valerenic acid and sesquiterpenes, which are believed to have calming effects on the central nervous system. Valerian capsules are typically taken orally, usually in the evening, to support relaxation and potentially reduce episodes of dizziness associated with stress or anxiety. While some studies suggest valerian may improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness specifically for dizziness.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal supplement often used for its potential mood-enhancing properties, but it is not typically recommended for the treatment of dizziness.</p><p>While some studies suggest that hypericum perforatum may influence neurotransmitter activity, its effectiveness for dizziness specifically has not been well-established in clinical research. Dizziness can stem from various causes, including inner ear disorders, dehydration, or low blood pressure, and it is important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause. Although some individuals may use hypericum perforatum as a complementary therapy, it can interact with numerous medications and may not be safe for everyone.</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial to approach its use with caution and under the guidance of a qualified medical practitioner.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum capsule" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its effects on dizziness.</p><p>The essential oils and compounds found in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, may help improve circulation and reduce inner ear disturbances that contribute to dizziness. Herbal capsules made from Cinnamomum verum are often taken as a natural remedy to alleviate symptoms of vertigo and motion sickness. These capsules are generally considered safe when used in recommended dosages, though they may interact with certain medications.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon capsules for dizziness, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy traditionally used to support immune function and reduce the duration of colds.</p><p>While it is widely recognized for its potential benefits in respiratory health, its role in alleviating dizziness is less well-documented in scientific studies. Some preliminary research suggests that echinacea may help reduce inflammation and support overall nervous system function, which could indirectly contribute to easing symptoms of dizziness. However, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific condition.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8.
