When used in a bath, ginkgo biloba can be infused into water, allowing the body to absorb its beneficial properties through the skin. This method is considered a gentle and natural way to incorporate the herb into one's wellness routine.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
