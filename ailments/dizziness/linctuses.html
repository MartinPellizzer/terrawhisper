Although limited clinical studies specifically address its use in linctus form for dizziness, some practitioners suggest that its adaptogenic properties may help support the body's response to stress, which can contribute to dizziness. It is often considered for conditions related to hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during menstruation or menopause, which can indirectly affect balance and cause dizziness.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While some studies suggest potential benefits for mild dizziness, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba linctuses may vary, and they should not replace conventional medical treatments for persistent or severe dizziness.</p><h2 id="3">3.

When considering its use for dizziness, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional, as it can interact with other medications and may have side effects.</p><p>Overall, while hypericum perforatum may offer some supportive benefits for dizziness, it should be used cautiously and in conjunction with a comprehensive treatment plan.</p><h2 id="7">7.
