Herbal teas made from valerian root are typically consumed in the evening to support sleep quality, as poor sleep can exacerbate feelings of dizziness. While valerian is generally considered safe for short-term use, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a regimen, especially for individuals with chronic dizziness or other underlying health conditions.</p><p>Overall, valerian herbal tea may offer a natural complement to managing dizziness, though it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><h2 id="3">3.
