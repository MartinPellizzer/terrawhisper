The active compounds in echinacea, such as polysaccharides and alkamides, may help improve circulation and reduce oxidative stress, which could contribute to alleviating dizziness in certain cases. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking echinacea to the relief of dizziness is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for this purpose.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7.
