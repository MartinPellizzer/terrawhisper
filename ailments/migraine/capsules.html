<h2 id="1">1. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms of migraine.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Vitex agnus-castus are often taken as a natural remedy to help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, particularly in women. The active compounds in Vitex, such as flavonoids and iridoids, may influence the pituitary gland and reduce stress-related hormonal fluctuations that can trigger migraines. While research on its efficacy for migraines is limited, some studies suggest it may help by modulating neurotransmitter activity and reducing inflammation.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting Vitex agnus-castus, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba)</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/ginkgo-biloba-capsules.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal capsules are commonly used as a natural remedy for migraine due to their potential to improve blood flow and reduce oxidative stress in the brain.</p><p>The active compounds in ginkgo biloba, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, are believed to enhance circulation and protect nerve cells, which may help alleviate migraine symptoms. Some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy. It is generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses, though it can interact with certain medications.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting ginkgo biloba, especially for individuals with chronic health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is widely used in herbal medicine for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Curcuma longa herbal capsules are often taken as a natural remedy to help alleviate symptoms of migraine by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. These capsules contain curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, which has been studied for its potential to modulate pain pathways and prevent migraine attacks. While some research suggests that curcumin may be beneficial in reducing migraine frequency, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting curcuma longa capsules, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential mood-enhancing properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild to moderate depression, recent research suggests it may also have beneficial effects for migraine management. Some studies indicate that the active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may help reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks by influencing neurotransmitter levels in the brain. However, it is important to note that the evidence for its efficacy in treating migraines is not as robust as for its use in depression, and more clinical trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially since it can interact with various medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/valeriana-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a perennial plant whose roots have been traditionally used for their calming effects.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing valerian root are often marketed for their potential to alleviate symptoms of migraine by reducing stress and anxiety, which are known triggers for migraine attacks. While scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for migraines is limited, some studies suggest that valerian may help improve sleep quality, which can indirectly support migraine management. It is typically taken as a dietary supplement, with recommended dosages varying based on the product and individual needs.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/zingiber-officinale-capsules.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular herbal remedy for migraine relief.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing zingiber officinale are designed to provide a concentrated and convenient form of ginger, allowing for easy integration into daily health routines. Studies suggest that ginger may help reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by influencing inflammatory pathways and neurotransmitter activity in the brain. These capsules are generally well-tolerated and can be used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for migraines.</p><p>However, individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using ginger supplements, especially if they are on medication or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cinnamomum-verum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its possible role in alleviating migraine symptoms.</p><p>The active compounds in cinnamon, such as cinnamic acid and eugenol, may help reduce inflammation and pain, which are key factors in migraine attacks. Some studies suggest that cinnamon's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties could support overall brain health and potentially reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines. However, more clinical research is needed to confirm its effectiveness as a treatment for migraines.</p><p>When considering herbal capsules containing Cinnamomum verum, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure safety and appropriate usage.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including its possible role in managing migraine symptoms.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the active compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are associated with migraine attacks. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Salvia officinalis are increasingly being explored as a natural alternative or complementary therapy for migraine relief. These capsules are typically taken in low doses and may be beneficial for individuals seeking non-pharmacological options for migraine management.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, as individual responses can vary and interactions with other medications may occur.</p><h2 id="9">9. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/urtica-dioica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including relief from migraine symptoms.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Urtica dioica are often marketed as natural remedies to help reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks. These capsules are believed to work by reducing inflammation and supporting detoxification processes in the body. Some studies suggest that the bioactive compounds in stinging nettle may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could aid in migraine management.</p><p>However, while some individuals may find relief from these capsules, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using them as part of a migraine treatment plan.</p><h2 id="10">10.

Some research indicates that the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of echinacea could help alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with migraines. However, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and determine the optimal dosage for migraine relief.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using echinacea purpurea capsules, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p>
