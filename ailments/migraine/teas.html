According to "Planta medica", Passiflora incarnata teas may be beneficial for migraine as the majority of phytoconstituents from P. incarnata were concurrently predicted to have the desired pleiotropic effects, including ameliorative roles in epilepsy and associated depression and memory deficit, which could suggest a potential beneficial effect on migraines.

alt="herbal teas with Curcuma longa">
<p>Curcuma longa teas have been traditionally used to treat migraine and its associated symptoms, due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, possess potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that help to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines.</p>
