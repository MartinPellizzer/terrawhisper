The herb contains compounds such as flavonoids and minerals that may support urinary tract health. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle tea, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest its benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy for cystitis.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While some studies suggest that horsetail may have antimicrobial effects, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for treating cystitis. When used in herbal teas, Equisetum arvense is typically combined with other bladder-supporting herbs like cranberry or uva ursi to enhance its therapeutic benefits.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using horsetail tea, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Berberis aristata</h2><img alt="berberis aristata tea" src="/images/preparations/berberis-aristata-teas.jpg"/><p>Berberis aristata, also known as Indian barberry, contains an active compound called berberine, which has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Herbal teas made from Berberis aristata may help support urinary tract health by reducing bacterial growth and inflammation associated with cystitis. Some studies suggest that berberine can inhibit the growth of uropathogens like E. coli, which are common causes of bladder infections.
