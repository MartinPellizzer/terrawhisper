These syrups may help alleviate symptoms such as burning sensation and frequent urges to urinate by supporting urinary tract health. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Urtica dioica syrups, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating cystitis.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal syrups made from sambucus nigra are typically prepared by combining the dried berries with honey or other natural sweeteners, making them easy to consume. These syrups are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for cystitis, though they should not replace medical advice.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sambucus nigra, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Plantain (Plantago lanceolata)</h2><img alt="plantago lanceolata syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/plantago-lanceolata-syrups.jpg"/><p>Plantago lanceolata, commonly known as plantain, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from Plantago lanceolata are often used to support urinary tract health, particularly in cases of cystitis, due to their potential to reduce irritation and inflammation in the bladder lining.
