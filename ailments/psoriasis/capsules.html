The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response, which are key factors in psoriasis. However, while some individuals report relief from psoriasis symptoms with curcumin, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using it as a treatment, as it may interact with other medications.</p><p>Overall, curcuma longa capsules can be a complementary therapy for psoriasis, but they should not replace conventional medical treatments without professional guidance.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for psoriasis is limited and more research is needed to confirm its role in treatment. As with any herbal supplement, hypericum perforatum can interact with other medications and may cause side effects, so it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Individuals with psoriasis considering this herbal option should consult their physician to determine if it is a safe and appropriate addition to their treatment plan.</p><h2 id="3">3.
