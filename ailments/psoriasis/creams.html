<h2 id="1">1. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/aloe-barbadensis-creams.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal creams for psoriasis due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These creams can help reduce redness, itching, and scaling associated with psoriasis by promoting skin hydration and cell regeneration. The gel from the aloe plant contains enzymes, vitamins, and antioxidants that may support skin health and reduce irritation. While aloe vera is generally safe for topical use, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a psoriasis treatment regimen.</p><p>Some individuals may experience allergic reactions, so a patch test is recommended before applying the cream extensively.</p><h2 id="2">2. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/hypericum-perforatum-creams.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When formulated into a topical cream, it may offer relief for individuals suffering from psoriasis by reducing skin inflammation and redness. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hypericin and hyperforin, may help modulate immune responses and reduce plaque formation. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these creams, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>While not a cure for psoriasis, hypericum perforatum herbal creams may serve as a complementary treatment option when used under professional guidance.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These creams often contain extracts of the leaves and roots, which are rich in antioxidants, minerals, and bioactive compounds that support skin health. Clinical studies suggest that regular use of stinging nettle-based topical treatments may help improve the condition of psoriatic skin by modulating inflammatory responses.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these creams, especially if you are on other medications or have sensitive skin.</p><h2 id="4">4. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/zingiber-officinale-creams.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it a potential ingredient in herbal creams for psoriasis.</p><p>These creams often combine ginger extract with other natural components such as turmeric, aloe vera, or coconut oil to enhance their therapeutic effects. The anti-inflammatory properties of ginger may help reduce redness, scaling, and itching associated with psoriasis by modulating the body's immune response. While some studies suggest that topical ginger may offer relief, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for long-term use in psoriasis management.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, ginger-based creams may be used alongside conventional treatments under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="5">5. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/salvia-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When incorporated into topical creams, salvia officinalis may help reduce the redness, scaling, and itching associated with psoriasis by soothing the skin and promoting healing. Some studies suggest that the essential oils in sage can modulate the immune response, potentially offering relief for psoriasis symptoms. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using sage-based creams, as they may interact with other treatments or cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>While not a cure, salvia officinalis herbal creams can serve as a complementary therapy for managing psoriasis symptoms.</p><h2 id="6">6. Taraxacum officinale</h2><img alt="taraxacum officinale cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/taraxacum-officinale-creams.jpg"/><p>Taraxacum officinale, commonly known as dandelion, is often used in herbal creams for psoriasis due to its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties.</p><p>These creams typically combine dandelion root and leaves with other natural ingredients to soothe irritated skin and reduce redness. The active compounds in dandelion, such as sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids, may help regulate skin cell growth and reduce plaque formation. While some users report relief from symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using herbal treatments, as they may interact with other medications.</p><p>Overall, dandelion-based creams offer a natural alternative for managing psoriasis, though their effectiveness can vary among individuals.</p><h2 id="7">7. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/equisetum-arvense-creams.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, also known as field horsetail, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for its high silica content and potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Herbal creams containing Equisetum arvense are often marketed for their ability to support skin health and may be used as a complementary treatment for psoriasis. These creams are typically formulated with other natural ingredients to enhance their soothing and healing effects on psoriatic skin. While some studies suggest that the silica in Equisetum arvense may help strengthen the skin barrier, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy for psoriasis.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/camellia-sinensis-creams.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, commonly known as the plant from which green tea is derived, has been explored for its potential benefits in the formulation of herbal creams for psoriasis.</p><p>These creams often incorporate extracts from Camellia sinensis due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may help reduce skin inflammation and redness associated with psoriasis. The polyphenols in green tea extract are believed to modulate immune responses and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially alleviating psoriatic symptoms. While some studies suggest that topical application of Camellia sinensis-based creams may offer symptomatic relief, more clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for long-term use in psoriasis treatment.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, these herbal creams may be used alongside conventional treatments under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="9">9. Sutherlandia frutescens</h2><img alt="sutherlandia frutescens cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/sutherlandia-frutescens-creams.jpg"/><p>Sutherlandia frutescens, commonly known as "cancer bush," is a traditional African herbal remedy that has gained attention for its potential benefits in managing psoriasis.</p><p>When formulated into creams, Sutherlandia frutescens may help reduce inflammation and redness associated with psoriasis due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in this herb may support skin healing and alleviate symptoms such as itching and scaling. However, while anecdotal evidence and preliminary research are promising, more clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for psoriasis treatment.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating Sutherlandia frutescens cream into a psoriasis management plan.</p><h2 id="10">10. Cannabis sativa</h2><img alt="cannabis sativa cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/cannabis-sativa-creams.jpg"/><p>Cannabis sativa herbal creams have gained attention as a potential topical treatment for psoriasis due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>These creams typically contain cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system to reduce skin inflammation and itching. Some studies suggest that cannabis-based creams may help alleviate the redness, scaling, and irritation associated with psoriasis, though more research is needed to confirm their long-term efficacy. While these creams are generally considered safe with minimal side effects, they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>As interest in natural remedies grows, cannabis sativa herbal creams are becoming an increasingly popular alternative or complement to conventional psoriasis treatments.</p>
