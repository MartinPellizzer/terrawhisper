When infused into a warm bath, chamomile can promote relaxation and improve circulation, which may help diminish the appearance of under-eye puffiness. The calming aroma of chamomile also has a soothing effect on the mind, making it a beneficial addition to a stress-relief routine.</p><p>However, it is important to ensure that the skin around the eyes is not sensitive to chamomile before using it in a bath or topical application.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The anti-inflammatory properties of rosehip can soothe tired, puffy eyes and alleviate swelling around the delicate eye area. To use it for eye bags, you can add a few drops of rosehip oil or a handful of dried rosehip to a warm bath, allowing the skin to absorb its beneficial nutrients.</p><p>Regular use of rosa canina herbal baths may contribute to a more refreshed and youthful appearance around the eyes.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The essential oils and active compounds in chamomile, such as bisabolol and chamazulene, have calming effects that may improve circulation and reduce fluid retention. To use chamomile for eye bags, one can steep dried chamomile flowers in hot water to create a chamomile tea, then allow it to cool before using it as a compress or adding it to a bath.</p><p>While herbal baths can offer natural relief, they should complement, not replace, professional medical advice for persistent or severe eye bag concerns.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia bath" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-baths.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal baths for its calming and soothing properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, lavender can help reduce stress and promote relaxation, which may indirectly alleviate the appearance of eye bags caused by fatigue or anxiety.
