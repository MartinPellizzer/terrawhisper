Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tincture" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis herbal tinctures, derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, are increasingly being used in natural remedies for the treatment of eye bags.</p><p>These tinctures are believed to contain bioactive compounds such as caffeine, theanine, and polyphenols, which may help reduce swelling and improve circulation around the eyes.

When used as a tincture, it is typically diluted with a carrier oil or alcohol to ensure safe topical application around the delicate eye area. Users should consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex tinctures, especially if they have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, while vitex may offer some supportive benefits for skin-related concerns, it is not a guaranteed solution for eye bags and should be used as part of a broader skincare and health regimen.</p>
