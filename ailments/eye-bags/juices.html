However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle juice, as it may interact with certain medications or cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.</p><p>Despite its popularity in alternative medicine, scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for eye bags remains limited.</p><h2 id="5">5.
