The active compounds in eucalyptus globulus, such as cineole, work by stimulating the mucous membranes and promoting clear airflow. It is often recommended for individuals suffering from colds, sinusitis, or allergic rhinitis as a natural alternative to over-the-counter decongestants.</p><p>However, it should be used with caution, as excessive use may cause irritation, and it is not suitable for children or individuals with certain medical conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These tinctures are typically made by steeping fresh or dried peppermint leaves in alcohol, allowing the beneficial oils to be extracted for medicinal use. Peppermint tinctures can be used as a nasal spray or applied topically to the chest and sinuses for relief.</p><p>While generally safe, they should be used with caution, especially in children and individuals with certain medical conditions, and it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare tincture" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to alleviate nasal congestion due to its expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Fennel tinctures are often prepared by soaking the dried seeds in alcohol to extract their active compounds, such as anethole and fenchone, which have soothing effects on the respiratory tract. These tinctures can help reduce mucus buildup and ease breathing by promoting the drainage of nasal passages.
