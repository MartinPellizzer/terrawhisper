While some studies suggest these oils may help alleviate symptoms and improve liver enzyme levels, more clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety in chronic hepatitis patients. It is important to consult with healthcare professionals before using essential oils, as they can interact with medications or have adverse effects.</p><p>Overall, herbal essential oils may offer supportive benefits but should not replace conventional medical treatments for chronic hepatitis.</p>
