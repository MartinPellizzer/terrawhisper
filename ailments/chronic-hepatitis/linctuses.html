<h2 id="1">1. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential hepatoprotective properties.</p><p>Silybum marianum herbal linctuses contain silymarin, a complex of flavonolignans that may help in the treatment of chronic hepatitis by reducing inflammation and promoting liver cell regeneration. These linctuses are often used as a complementary therapy to support liver function in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. The active compounds in silymarin have shown antioxidant and antifibrotic effects, which may aid in preventing liver damage.</p><p>However, while some studies suggest potential benefits, more clinical research is needed to fully establish their efficacy and safety in treating chronic hepatitis.</p><h2 id="2">2. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa linctuse" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a bioactive compound with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Herbal linctuses made from Curcuma longa have been explored as a complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis, particularly in reducing liver inflammation and oxidative stress.

Herbal linctuses containing zingiber officinale are being explored as complementary therapy to support conventional treatments for liver diseases. These formulations may aid in alleviating symptoms such as nausea and fatigue associated with chronic hepatitis.</p><p>However, further clinical research is needed to fully establish their efficacy and safety in this context.</p><h2 id="5">5. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita linctuse" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Peppermint herbal linctuses, which are typically formulated with menthol and other natural extracts, are sometimes used as complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis to help alleviate symptoms such as nausea, bloating, and digestive discomfort. These linctuses may support liver function by promoting detoxification and reducing oxidative stress, although their efficacy in treating the underlying condition of hepatitis remains under research. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using peppermint linctuses, as they may interact with certain medications or exacerbate gastrointestinal issues in some individuals.</p><p>While not a cure, peppermint linctuses can be a useful adjunct in managing the symptoms associated with chronic hepatitis.</p><h2 id="6">6. Tussilago farfara</h2><img alt="tussilago farfara linctuse" src="/images/preparations/tussilago-farfara-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Tussilago farfara, commonly known as coltsfoot, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>While it is often employed as a linctus for respiratory conditions such as coughs and bronchitis, its potential benefits for chronic hepatitis are less well-documented in modern scientific research. Some studies suggest that Tussilago farfara may support liver health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key factors in the progression of chronic hepatitis. However, due to limited clinical evidence, it is not currently recommended as a primary treatment for hepatitis without further rigorous testing.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7.
