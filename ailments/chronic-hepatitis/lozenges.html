These lozenges offer a convenient and palatable form of silymarin supplementation, making it easier for patients to adhere to long-term treatment regimens. While research on their efficacy in chronic hepatitis is ongoing, preliminary studies suggest potential benefits in liver regeneration and protection.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, silybum marianum lozenges may support conventional treatments, though they should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="2">2. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra herbal lozenges are often formulated to support liver health and may help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic hepatitis by reducing inflammation in the liver tissue. These lozenges contain glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its potential to inhibit viral replication, particularly in hepatitis B and C infections. However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Despite these considerations, glycyrrhiza glabra lozenges may serve as a complementary therapy in the management of chronic hepatitis when integrated with conventional treatments.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These lozenges offer a convenient and palatable way to deliver curcumin, enhancing its bioavailability when combined with black pepper extract or other synergistic ingredients. Clinical studies suggest that regular consumption of curcuma longa lozenges may support liver function and aid in the management of chronic hepatitis, though further research is needed to establish optimal dosages and long-term efficacy.</p><p>As part of an integrative approach, these lozenges may provide a natural adjunct to conventional treatments for hepatitis patients.</p><h2 id="4">4. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it a potential complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing ginger extract may help alleviate symptoms such as nausea, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with liver conditions. Some studies suggest that ginger may support liver function by promoting detoxification and reducing hepatic inflammation. However, while ginger is generally safe, it should be used cautiously in individuals with severe liver disease or those on certain medications.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using ginger lozenges as part of a treatment plan for chronic hepatitis.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Berberis aristata</h2><img alt="berberis aristata lozenge" src="/images/preparations/berberis-aristata-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Berberis aristata herbal lozenges, derived from the roots of the Himalayan barberry plant, have been traditionally used for their potent anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These lozenges contain berberine, an alkaloid known for its ability to support liver function and reduce oxidative stress, which are critical in managing chronic hepatitis.

Taraxacum officinale</h2><img alt="taraxacum officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/taraxacum-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Taraxacum officinale, commonly known as dandelion, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential liver-supporting properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing Taraxacum officinale are formulated to provide a convenient and palatable way to consume this herb, which is believed to aid in the detoxification process and support liver function. These lozenges may be particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic hepatitis, as they may help reduce inflammation and promote the regeneration of liver cells. However, while some preliminary studies suggest possible benefits, more clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety in treating chronic hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with pre-existing liver conditions or on medication.</p><h2 id="10">10.
