While some studies suggest that certain herbs can improve liver function and alleviate symptoms, the efficacy and safety of herbal treatments for chronic hepatitis require further scientific validation. It is important for patients to consult with healthcare professionals before using herbal decoctions, as they may interact with prescription medications or have adverse effects.</p><p>Overall, herbal decoctions can be a complementary approach to conventional treatments, but they should not replace medical care for chronic hepatitis.</p><div class="toc">
