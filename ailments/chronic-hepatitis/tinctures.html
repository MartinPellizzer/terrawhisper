Clinical studies suggest that silymarin may help reduce liver inflammation and promote the regeneration of liver cells, potentially improving liver function in patients with hepatitis B or C. However, while some research supports its use, more rigorous, large-scale studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in chronic hepatitis management.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using silybum marianum tinctures, especially for those with existing liver conditions or on medication.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These tinctures may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in liver tissues, potentially supporting liver function and reducing the progression of liver damage. However, while preliminary studies show promise, more clinical research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety in treating chronic hepatitis.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Curcuma longa tinctures should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure proper integration with standard medical treatments.</p><h2 id="3">3. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra tincture" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties.</p><p>Herbal tinctures made from Glycyrrhiza glabra are often utilized in the management of chronic hepatitis due to their ability to modulate immune responses and reduce liver inflammation. The active compounds, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, exhibit antiviral effects against hepatitis B and C viruses, supporting liver function and regeneration. However, long-term use of licorice tinctures may lead to side effects like hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, necessitating careful monitoring.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Glycyrrhiza glabra tinctures should be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider for optimal safety and efficacy in chronic hepatitis management.</p><h2 id="4">4.
