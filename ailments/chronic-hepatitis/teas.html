However, its use in chronic hepatitis requires careful consideration due to potential interactions with antiviral medications and its impact on liver enzymes. Some preliminary research indicates that hypericum perforatum may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, which are key factors in the progression of hepatitis.</p><p>Despite these promising findings, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's wort as a complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis.</p><h2 id="6">6.

However, while some preliminary research supports its use, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for chronic hepatitis.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating dandelion tea into a treatment regimen for liver conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, has been traditionally used for its high content of antioxidants, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory compounds, making it a potential complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis.</p><p>Studies suggest that the bioactive components in rosehip tea, such as vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenols, may support liver health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. While not a substitute for conventional medical treatments, rosa canina herbal tea is often recommended as a supportive remedy to aid in liver detoxification and improve overall well-being in patients with chronic hepatitis. Its mild and soothing properties make it a safe option for long-term consumption, although it is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a treatment regimen.</p><p>Overall, rosa canina herbal tea may offer beneficial effects when used alongside standard medical care for managing chronic hepatitis.</p><h2 id="9">9.
