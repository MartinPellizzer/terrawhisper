<p>Runny nose is a common cold symptom characterized by an excessive production of nasal mucus, often caused by allergies, colds, or sinus infections.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been a popular choice to treat this ailment due to their natural and non-invasive properties, offering relief from congestion, itching, and sneezing.</p>
<p>Various herbs such as eucalyptus, peppermint, and ginger are commonly used to treat runny nose, as they contain compounds like menthol and eugenol that help to thin and clear mucus.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eucalyptus oil in a humidifier, peppermint tea, and ginger syrup are effective in soothing the nasal passages and providing quick relief from runny nose symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes runny nose?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of runny nose are allergies and infections, particularly the common cold and sinusitis, which trigger an increase in mucus production and nasal congestion.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include exposure to environmental irritants, such as pollution and tobacco smoke, as well as hormonal changes, which can exacerbate existing conditions.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing a runny nose include working in dusty or polluted environments, smoking, and consuming dairy products, as these can trigger allergic reactions or irritate the nasal passages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, stress and lack of sleep can also contribute to a weakened immune system, making individuals more susceptible to respiratory issues like a runny nose.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal runny nose?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat runny nose are Echinacea, Goldenseal, and Yarrow, which possess therapeutic actions such as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Echinacea contains bioactive compounds like alkylamides and glycosides, which help to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.</p>
<p>Goldenseal's berberine has antimicrobial properties that combat infections and reduce nasal congestion, while Yarrow's sesquiterpene lactones have anti-inflammatory effects that soothe the nasal mucosa.</p>
<p>These herbs work together to alleviate symptoms of runny nose by reducing inflammation, combating infections, and promoting overall health and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat runny nose?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat runny nose are teas, infusions, and syrups that help to reduce nasal congestion and clear out excess mucus.</p>
<p>Drinking warm infusions made with fragrant flowers can help to loosen and clear out mucus, while also reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.</p>
<p>Syrups made from the roots of certain plants can help to soothe and calm the nasal passages, reducing the production of excess mucus and relieving congestion.</p>
<p>Additionally, teas made from certain leaves and roots can help to decongest and clear out the nasal passages, providing quick relief from runny nose symptoms.</p>
