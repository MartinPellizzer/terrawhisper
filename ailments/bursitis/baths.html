The aromatic compounds in lavender have been shown to possess mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, which may support the body's natural healing processes. To use lavender in a bursitis bath, simply add a few drops of lavender essential oil or a handful of dried lavender to warm water and soak for 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>While herbal baths can provide soothing relief, they should be used in conjunction with other medical treatments recommended by a healthcare professional for optimal results.</p><h2 id="9">9. Symphytum officinale</h2><img alt="symphytum officinale bath" src="/images/preparations/symphytum-officinale-baths.jpg"/><p>Symphytum officinale, commonly known as comfrey, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to alleviate symptoms of bursitis due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When used in a bath, the active compounds in comfrey, such as allantoin and rosmarinic acid, may help reduce swelling and promote tissue repair around the affected bursae.
