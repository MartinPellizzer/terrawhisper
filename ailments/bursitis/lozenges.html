However, it is important to note that herbal lozenges are not a primary treatment for bursitis and should be used as a complementary therapy under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They may offer mild relief for some individuals, but their effectiveness for bursitis has not been extensively studied in clinical trials.</p><p>Patients with bursitis should prioritize medical evaluation and treatment plans that address the underlying cause of their condition.</p>
