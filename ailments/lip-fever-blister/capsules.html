The herb may interact with certain medications, so it is crucial to consult a doctor before use, especially if you are taking anticoagulants or antidepressants.</p><p>Overall, while it may offer some relief, it should not replace medical advice or standard treatments for fever blisters.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These capsules are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, though their efficacy for fever blisters specifically has not been extensively studied in clinical trials. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Camellia sinensis supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, while Camellia sinensis herbal capsules may offer some supportive benefits, they should not be relied upon as a primary treatment for fever blisters.</p><h2 id="4">4.
