Studies suggest that the bioactive compounds in ginger, such as gingerols and shogaols, can inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body. However, while some individuals report relief from using ginger-based topical treatments, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if other medications are being taken.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These topical treatments offer a natural alternative to conventional pharmaceuticals, with fewer side effects.

Clinical studies have shown that topical application of capsaicin can provide significant relief for joint pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. However, the use of these creams may cause a temporary burning sensation at the application site, which can be uncomfortable for some users.</p><p>Despite this, many individuals find capsaicin-based creams to be a safe and effective alternative or adjunct to conventional pain medications for managing osteoarthritis symptoms.</p><h2 id="6">6.

These creams work by inhibiting the production of inflammatory compounds in the body, which can help alleviate symptoms associated with the condition. Clinical studies have shown promising results, suggesting that Boswellia serrata may offer a safer alternative or adjunct to conventional treatments.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these creams, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that sage extracts may help reduce pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis when applied topically.

Clinical studies suggest that silymarin may help reduce joint pain and improve mobility in individuals with osteoarthritis by inhibiting inflammatory pathways. However, while some research supports its efficacy, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm its long-term benefits and safety.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, silybum marianum herbal creams may be used alongside conventional treatments under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="10">10. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium cream" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-creams.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When formulated into creams, it may offer relief for individuals suffering from osteoarthritis by reducing joint inflammation and pain. These herbal creams are often made with a base of carrier oils and essential oils extracted from yarrow, which can be applied topically to affected areas.
