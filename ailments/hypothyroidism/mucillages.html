However, it is important to note that mucillages themselves do not directly affect thyroid hormone production or regulation. Hypothyroidism typically requires medical management with thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and herbal supplements should not replace prescribed treatments.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially for conditions like hypothyroidism.</p>
