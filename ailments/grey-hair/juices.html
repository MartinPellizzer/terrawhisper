Regular consumption of hibiscus-based herbal juices is believed to stimulate hair follicles and improve blood circulation to the scalp, which can support healthy hair growth. Some studies suggest that the high levels of flavonoids and anthocyanins in hibiscus may help in preventing oxidative stress, a factor linked to hair pigmentation loss.</p><p>While more research is needed, many people incorporate hibiscus herbal juices into their routine as a natural remedy to support hair health and potentially delay the onset of grey hair.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex negundo</h2><img alt="vitex negundo juice" src="/images/preparations/vitex-negundo-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex negundo, commonly known as the chaste tree or vitex, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in promoting hair health.</p><p>Herbal juices made from Vitex negundo are believed to support the growth of healthy, lustrous hair and may help reduce the appearance of grey hair by stimulating melanin production.
