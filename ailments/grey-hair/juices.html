The herb is thought to enhance circulation to the scalp and support melanin production, which may help delay the onset of grey hair. Some studies suggest that the antioxidants and bioactive compounds in Bacopa monnieri can reduce oxidative stress, a factor linked to hair aging.</p><p>As a result, incorporating Bacopa monnieri herbal juices into one's routine may offer a natural approach to maintaining youthful hair color and vitality.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Regular consumption of hibiscus-based herbal juices is believed to stimulate hair follicles and improve blood circulation to the scalp, which can support healthy hair growth. Some studies suggest that the high levels of flavonoids and anthocyanins in hibiscus may help in preventing oxidative stress, a factor linked to hair pigmentation loss.</p><p>While more research is needed, many people incorporate hibiscus herbal juices into their routine as a natural remedy to support hair health and potentially delay the onset of grey hair.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex negundo</h2><img alt="vitex negundo juice" src="/images/preparations/vitex-negundo-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex negundo, commonly known as the chaste tree or vitex, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in promoting hair health.</p><p>Herbal juices made from Vitex negundo are believed to support the growth of healthy, lustrous hair and may help reduce the appearance of grey hair by stimulating melanin production.

However, there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to the reversal of grey hair.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Withania somnifera</h2><img alt="withania somnifera juice" src="/images/preparations/withania-somnifera-juices.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, also known as ashwagandha, is an ancient Ayurvedic herb that has been traditionally used for its adaptogenic and rejuvenating properties.</p><p>While it is not directly known for causing grey hair, some studies suggest that it may support overall hair health by reducing stress and promoting hormonal balance, which are factors in premature graying.
