These tinctures are typically prepared by soaking herbs in alcohol or vinegar to extract their active compounds, making them easy to apply directly to the scalp or hair. Many people use them as part of a holistic approach to hair care, combining them with regular routines like scalp massage and a balanced diet.</p><p>While they are generally considered safe, it's important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have sensitive skin or underlying health conditions.</p><div class="toc">
