Prunus domestica</h2><img alt="prunus domestica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/prunus-domestica-teas.jpg"/><p>Prunus domestica, commonly known as the European blackberry, is not typically associated with herbal teas for grey hair, but some traditional and alternative medicine practices suggest that certain berry-based teas may support hair health.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking blackberries to preventing grey hair, they are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that can promote overall hair vitality. Herbal teas made from blackberries may help nourish the scalp and improve circulation, which could indirectly support hair pigmentation. However, it's important to note that grey hair is primarily influenced by genetics, aging, and oxidative stress, so no single herb can reverse this process.</p><p>For those interested in natural remedies for hair health, consulting a healthcare professional is recommended to ensure safe and effective use of herbal teas.</p><h2 id="9">9.
