The aromatic properties of rosemary can also stimulate the senses and provide a calming effect, which is particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing persistent ringing or buzzing in the ears.

Some studies suggest that regular use of lavender-infused baths may help alleviate the perception of ringing or buzzing in the ears by reducing overall stress levels.</p><p>While herbal baths should not replace medical treatment for tinnitus, they can serve as a complementary therapy to enhance well-being and manage symptoms more effectively.</p><h2 id="6">6.
