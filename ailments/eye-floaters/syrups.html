While some users report improved vision or reduced floaters after regular use, scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using herbal syrups, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>Overall, herbal syrups can be considered as a complementary approach, but they should not replace medical treatment for serious eye conditions.</p><div class="toc">
