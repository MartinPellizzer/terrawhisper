Some traditional and alternative medicine practices suggest that consuming mucillages may help reduce the appearance of floaters by improving the consistency and clarity of the vitreous. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness for eye floaters is limited, and they should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><p>Individuals experiencing persistent or sudden floaters should consult an ophthalmologist to rule out more serious underlying conditions.</p><div class="toc">
