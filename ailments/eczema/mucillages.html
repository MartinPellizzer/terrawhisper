They can be applied topically in the form of poultices, creams, or gels to alleviate dryness, redness, and itching associated with eczema. Some studies suggest that certain mucillaginous herbs may also have antimicrobial effects, which can help prevent infections in broken skin.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to perform a patch test before using any new herbal preparation to avoid allergic reactions.</p>

Some studies suggest that the mucilage may help reduce skin irritation and improve the skin's barrier function, which is often compromised in eczema. When applied topically, it can provide a protective layer that may alleviate dryness and redness.</p><p>However, while preliminary research is promising, more clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for eczema treatment.</p><h2 id="5">5. Marigold (Calendula officinalis)</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis mucillage" src="/images/preparations/mucillages/calendula-officinalis-mucillages.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, contains herbal mucillages that have been traditionally used for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These mucillages form a protective layer on the skin, helping to reduce irritation and promote healing in cases of eczema.

The mucilage acts as a protective barrier, helping to moisturize and calm the skin, thereby alleviating symptoms such as dryness and itching. While research on its direct efficacy for eczema is limited, some preliminary studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of milk thistle may support skin health.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, silybum marianum mucillages may be considered alongside conventional treatments for eczema, though consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended before use.</p><h2 id="7">7. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita mucillage" src="/images/preparations/mucillages/chamomilla-recutita-mucillages.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, contains mucillages that have been traditionally used for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These mucillages form a protective layer on the skin, helping to reduce irritation and promote healing in cases of eczema.

While some studies suggest that the mucillages may have anti-inflammatory effects, it is important to note that the use of comfrey for eczema should be approached with caution due to potential toxicity from its pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The mucillages can be applied topically in the form of poultices or ointments to provide relief from dryness and itching associated with eczema.</p><p>However, long-term or internal use of comfrey is not recommended, and it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it for skin conditions.</p><h2 id="10">10.
