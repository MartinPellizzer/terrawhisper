They can be applied topically in the form of poultices, creams, or gels to alleviate dryness, redness, and itching associated with eczema. Some studies suggest that certain mucillaginous herbs may also have antimicrobial effects, which can help prevent infections in broken skin.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to perform a patch test before using any new herbal preparation to avoid allergic reactions.</p>
