They are typically applied directly to the lips using a clean brush or applicator, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate and nourish the skin. Unlike traditional lip balms, herbal syrups provide a more intense hydration due to their glycerin and honey content, which help lock in moisture.</p><p>They are especially beneficial for individuals seeking a gentle, natural alternative to chemical-laden lip products.</p>
