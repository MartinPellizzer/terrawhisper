While there is limited direct scientific evidence linking ginkgo biloba to the treatment of erectile dysfunction, some herbal teas containing this ingredient are marketed as natural supplements for sexual health. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba, as it may interact with certain medications and has potential side effects.</p><p>Overall, while ginkgo biloba herbal teas may offer general health benefits, their effectiveness for erectile dysfunction remains inconclusive and should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="5">5.
