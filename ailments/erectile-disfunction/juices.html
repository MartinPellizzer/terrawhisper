While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking ginkgo biloba herbal juices to the treatment of erectile dysfunction, some studies have indicated that its compounds, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, may enhance blood circulation and reduce oxidative stress. However, it is important to note that more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific use.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating ginkgo biloba into a regimen for erectile dysfunction.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal plant traditionally used for its potential liver-protective properties.</p><p>While it is not specifically marketed for erectile dysfunction, some studies suggest that its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds may support overall vascular health, which could indirectly benefit sexual function. Herbal juices made from silybum marianum are often consumed for their detoxifying effects, but their role in treating erectile dysfunction remains largely anecdotal and not well-supported by clinical trials. Some proponents believe that improved liver function and reduced oxidative stress may enhance blood flow and hormone balance, which are important factors in sexual health.</p><p>However, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using silybum marianum or any herbal remedy for erectile dysfunction, as its efficacy and safety in this context require further scientific validation.</p><h2 id="10">10.
