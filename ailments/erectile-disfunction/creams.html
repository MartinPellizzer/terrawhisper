However, scientific evidence supporting their efficacy is limited, and their potency can vary significantly depending on the formulation and quality of the product. While some users report mild improvements in erection quality, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, as they may interact with other medications or underlying health conditions.</p><p>Overall, herbal creams should not be considered a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction without proper medical guidance.</p><div class="toc">
