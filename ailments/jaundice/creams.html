These creams typically contain curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, which is believed to aid in the regeneration of liver cells and the normalization of bilirubin levels. While some studies suggest that curcumin may have beneficial effects on liver health, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such creams, especially for individuals with severe or chronic liver conditions.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, curcuma longa herbal creams may offer supportive benefits when used alongside conventional treatments for jaundice.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These creams may help reduce inflammation and promote skin healing, which could be beneficial for individuals with jaundice-related skin discoloration. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence directly linking Andrographis paniculata creams to the treatment of jaundice itself.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these products, especially for conditions like jaundice that may require more targeted medical intervention.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Herbal creams containing glycyrrhiza glabra are often formulated to provide localized relief and enhance the body's natural ability to process bilirubin, a key factor in jaundice. While these creams may complement conventional treatments, they should not replace medical advice or prescribed therapies.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice-based products, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.
