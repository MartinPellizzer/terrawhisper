Herbal creams containing aloe barbadensis are believed to provide topical relief by reducing inflammation and promoting skin healing, although their effectiveness in treating jaundice itself remains under scientific scrutiny. While some individuals use these creams as part of a holistic approach to managing jaundice, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, as jaundice can indicate serious underlying health issues.</p><p>Overall, while aloe vera may offer complementary benefits, it should not replace conventional medical treatments for jaundice.</p><h2 id="9">9.
