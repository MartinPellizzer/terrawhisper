These lotions are often prepared by infusing fresh or dried ginger in a carrier oil or water, and they are applied topically to the skin for absorption. While some studies suggest that ginger may have beneficial effects on liver health, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment for jaundice, as it should not replace conventional medical care.</p><p>Overall, ginger-based herbal lotions are considered a complementary therapy rather than a primary treatment for jaundice.</p><h2 id="9">9.
