While they may help reduce throat irritation and support the body's natural defenses, they are not a substitute for medical treatment in cases of severe or persistent lymph node enlargement. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if lymph node swelling persists, as it could indicate an underlying health condition.</p><p>Overall, herbal lozenges can be a complementary approach to managing mild symptoms, but they should be used alongside proper medical evaluation and care.</p><div class="toc">
