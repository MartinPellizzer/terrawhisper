While they are not a cure for lymph node enlargement, they can support overall immune function and reduce discomfort associated with swollen lymph nodes. Some traditional herbal remedies incorporate mucillages to promote detoxification and lymphatic drainage.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these natural remedies, especially if the swelling is persistent or accompanied by other symptoms.</p><div class="toc">
