However, it is important to note that while some individuals may find it beneficial, scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for cold sores is limited.</p><p>As with any topical treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort cream, especially if you are taking other medications or have sensitive skin.</p><h2 id="2">2.
