The warming effect of ginger can promote blood circulation and potentially speed up the healing process. While some studies suggest that ginger may have antiviral properties, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness against HSV-1.</p><p>As with any topical treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have sensitive skin or are using other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of aloe vera may promote faster healing and prevent secondary infections. When applied topically, aloe-based creams can provide a cooling effect that alleviates the burning sensation often felt during a cold sore outbreak.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially if the cold sore is severe or persistent.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Herbal creams containing Camellia sinensis extracts are often marketed as natural remedies to soothe and heal cold sore blisters.
