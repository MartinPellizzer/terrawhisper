They work by forming a protective barrier over the skin and reducing irritation caused by acid reflux, though they are not a cure for the underlying condition. While they can provide relief for mild discomfort, they should be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medical treatment.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal creams, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><div class="toc">
