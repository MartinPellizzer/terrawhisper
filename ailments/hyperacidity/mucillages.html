When consumed as a herbal tea or supplement, it can alleviate symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion associated with hyperacidity.</p><p>Due to its gentle nature, Althaea officinalis is often considered a safe and effective alternative for those seeking natural relief from acid-related conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Plantago ovata</h2><img alt="plantago ovata mucillage" src="/images/preparations/plantago-ovata-mucillages.jpg"/><p>Plantago ovata, commonly known as psyllium husk, is a rich source of soluble fiber that can be used to prepare herbal mucillages, which are beneficial for managing hyperacidity.</p><p>When soaked in water, the mucilage forms a gel-like substance that coats the stomach lining, providing a protective barrier against excess stomach acid. This natural remedy helps to neutralize acidity and reduce symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. The mucilage also promotes healthy digestion by regulating bowel movements and improving overall gastrointestinal function.</p><p>Due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, plantago ovata mucilage is a safe and effective alternative for individuals seeking natural relief from hyperacidity.</p><h2 id="5">5.
