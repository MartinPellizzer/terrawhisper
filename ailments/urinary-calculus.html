<p>Urinary calculus is a medical condition characterized by the formation of small, hard stones in the kidneys, bladder, or ureters, which can cause severe pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat urinary calculus, offering a natural and effective approach to alleviate symptoms and prevent future stone formation.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as Juniper berries, Corn silk, and Uva ursi are commonly used to treat urinary calculus due to their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties, which help to flush out the kidneys and reduce pain.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as teas, infusions, and tinctures of herbs like Marshmallow root, Dandelion, and Celery seeds can be used to treat urinary calculus, providing relief from symptoms and promoting overall kidney health.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes urinary calculus?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of urinary calculus are an imbalance of minerals in the urine, such as calcium, oxalate, and uric acid, which can lead to the formation of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include dehydration, certain medical conditions like kidney disease, and certain medications like diuretics, which can increase the concentration of minerals in the urine.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing urinary calculus include a diet high in animal protein and low in fiber, as well as a lack of physical activity, which can lead to dehydration and an imbalance of minerals in the urine.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with a family history of kidney stones are also at a higher risk, as genetic factors can play a role in the formation of urinary calculus.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal urinary calculus?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat urinary calculus are a blend of diuretics and lithotriptics, such as Juniperus communis and Berberis vulgaris.</p>
<p>Juniperus communis, for instance, exhibits a diuretic action due to its high content of volatile oils, particularly limonene and beta-pinene, which help increase urine production and reduce the risk of stone formation.</p>
<p>Berberis vulgaris, on the other hand, contains berberine, a bioactive compound that has been shown to inhibit the growth of bacteria that contribute to the development of urinary calculi.</p>
<p>Additionally, the herb Hydrangea arborescens has been traditionally used to treat urinary calculus due to its anti-inflammatory and litholytic properties, which help to dissolve and eliminate kidney stones.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat urinary calculus?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat urinary calculus are often consumed as teas, infusions, or decoctions, and are believed to help dissolve and flush out kidney stones through their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Some of these herbal preparations are made with plants that have been traditionally used to reduce inflammation and promote the passage of urine, while others are used to help break down and dissolve the stones themselves.</p>
<p>Others may be used to help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with urinary calculus, such as through their analgesic and antispasmodic properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal preparations may be used to help prevent the formation of new stones by supporting kidney function and promoting the excretion of excess minerals.</p>
