<p>Gastritis is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the stomach lining, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat gastritis, offering a natural and effective approach to alleviate symptoms and promote healing.</p>
<p>Herbs such as aloe vera, slippery elm, and licorice root are commonly used to soothe and protect the stomach lining, while others like ginger, peppermint, and chamomile help to reduce inflammation and relax the digestive system.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like teas, tinctures, and infusions, as well as supplements like capsules and tablets, can be used to treat gastritis, with some popular examples including aloe vera juice, slippery elm tea, and ginger capsules, all of which are effective in providing relief from gastritis symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes gastritis?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of gastritis are an infection by the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which damage the stomach lining and cause inflammation.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of gastritis include stress, certain foods and drinks, and underlying medical conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which can trigger inflammation in the stomach.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing gastritis include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor diet, as these can weaken the stomach lining and reduce its ability to protect itself from acid and other irritants.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who work at night, experience chronic stress, or have a family history of gastritis may also be more prone to developing the condition due to their increased exposure to potential irritants and stressors.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal gastritis?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat gastritis are Aloe vera, Licorice root, and Turmeric, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help to reduce inflammation and protect the stomach lining.</p>
<p>Aloe vera contains bioactive compounds like aloin and aloe-emodin, which have been shown to exhibit gastroprotective and anti-ulcerative effects by reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing.</p>
<p>Licorice root contains compounds like glycyrrhizin, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help to soothe and heal the stomach lining, reducing symptoms of gastritis.</p>
<p>Turmeric, on the other hand, contains curcumin, a polyphenol with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the stomach, thereby alleviating gastritis symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat gastritis?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat gastritis are numerous and offer relief through their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p>
<p>Infusions and teas made from certain plants can help reduce inflammation in the stomach lining, while others can aid in digestion and prevent further irritation.</p>
<p>For example, a decoction of a specific plant can protect the stomach lining from acid damage, while an herbal tea blend can calm the digestive system and reduce symptoms of gastritis.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal infusions can also help to reduce the production of stomach acid, promoting a healthier digestive balance.</p>
