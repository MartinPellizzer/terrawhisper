While some herbal remedies may have anti-inflammatory or muscle-relaxing properties, they are not specifically formulated for neck stiffness and should not replace professional medical advice. It is important to consult a healthcare provider if the stiffness persists or is accompanied by severe pain, headaches, or neurological symptoms.</p><p>For effective relief, a combination of rest, proper posture, and targeted treatments is usually recommended.</p>

Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/vitex-agnus-castus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential effects on hormonal balance and muscle relaxation.</p><p>While it is not classified as a linctus, some formulations containing vitex may be used in combination with other herbs to support relief from symptoms associated with a stiff neck, such as muscle tension and inflammation. The herb is believed to influence the pituitary gland and may help alleviate stress-related tension that contributes to neck stiffness. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence specifically supporting the use of vitex for stiff neck, and it should be used under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, potential interactions and side effects should be considered, and it should not replace professional medical advice for persistent or severe neck pain.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/echinacea-purpurea-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used for its immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for supporting the immune system, some anecdotal reports suggest that echinacea-based linctuses may help alleviate symptoms of a stiff neck by reducing inflammation and promoting circulation. These linctuses typically contain extracts of the plant's flowers and roots, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for stiff neck specifically is limited, and it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/zingiber-officinale-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a potential natural remedy for a stiff neck.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal linctuses, ginger can help alleviate muscle tension and reduce inflammation in the cervical region. These linctuses are typically prepared by combining powdered ginger root with a base of honey or glycerin, creating a soothing and easily absorbed topical application. The warming effect of ginger may improve blood circulation and ease discomfort associated with a stiff neck.</p><p>However, while some individuals may find relief using ginger-based linctuses, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe neck stiffness.</p><h2 id="4">4. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/rosmarinus-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential benefits for respiratory and musculoskeletal health.</p><p>Rosemary herbal linctuses, which are medicated syrups, may help alleviate symptoms of a stiff neck by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation in the affected area. These linctuses often contain essential oils derived from rosemary leaves, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. While they are not a direct treatment for neck stiffness, they may support overall wellness and ease discomfort when used as part of a holistic approach.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using rosemary linctuses, especially for persistent or severe neck issues.</p><h2 id="5">5. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/glycyrrhiza-glabra-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it can help alleviate symptoms of a stiff neck by reducing inflammation and easing muscle tension. The active compounds in licorice, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, may contribute to its effectiveness in calming sore muscles and improving circulation. This natural remedy is often preferred for its gentle action and minimal side effects compared to synthetic medications.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using licorice-based linctuses, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with hypertension.</p><h2 id="6">6. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/salvia-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it may help soothe the throat and reduce inflammation, which can be beneficial for individuals experiencing a stiff neck accompanied by throat irritation or coughing. The essential oils in sage, such as thujone and camphor, are believed to have a warming effect that may improve circulation and alleviate muscle tension in the neck area. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage linctus, as it may interact with certain medications or cause adverse effects in some individuals.</p><p>While sage linctus is not a cure for stiff neck, it may offer supportive relief as part of a holistic approach to managing the condition.</p><h2 id="7">7. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/cinnamomum-verum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its warming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or cough syrup, it can help alleviate symptoms associated with a stiff neck by improving circulation and reducing muscle tension. The essential oils in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, have analgesic and antispasmodic effects that may provide relief from pain and stiffness. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon linctus, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><p>While not a substitute for medical treatment, cinnamon-based remedies can be a complementary approach to managing mild neck discomfort.</p><h2 id="8">8. Black pepper (Piper nigrum)</h2><img alt="piper nigrum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/piper-nigrum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries in various medicinal practices.</p><p>When formulated into a linctus, or medicinal syrup, it may provide relief for symptoms associated with a stiff neck by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation.

While some individuals may find relief using black pepper linctus, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it for persistent or severe neck stiffness.</p><p>This herbal remedy is often used as a complementary therapy rather than a standalone treatment for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/achillea-millefolium-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, it may help alleviate symptoms associated with a stiff neck by reducing inflammation and soothing muscle tension.
