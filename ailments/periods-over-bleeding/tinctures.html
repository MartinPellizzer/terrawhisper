However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using it, as it may interact with hormonal medications or affect blood clotting.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><h2 id="4">4.
