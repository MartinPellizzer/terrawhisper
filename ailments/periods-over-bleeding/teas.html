However, it is important to note that fennel tea should be used with caution, as it may interact with certain medications or exacerbate conditions like hormone-sensitive cancers. While some studies suggest its potential benefits, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for this specific use.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating fennel tea into a menstrual health regimen.</p><h2 id="2">2. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal teas to support menstrual health, including managing heavy bleeding during periods.</p><p>The herb is rich in nutrients such as iron, vitamins, and minerals that can help replenish the body’s resources lost during menstruation. Its astringent properties are believed to help reduce excessive menstrual flow by tightening blood vessels and promoting uterine tone. While some studies suggest that stinging nettle may have mild hemostatic effects, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using it, especially for those with existing health conditions or on medication.</p><p>When prepared as a tea, urtica dioica can be a natural complement to a holistic approach to managing period-related bleeding.</p><h2 id="3">3. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/vitex-agnus-castus-teas.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may help regulate menstrual cycles.</p><p>Herbal teas made from vitex are often recommended for women experiencing irregular periods or heavy bleeding due to their potential to influence progesterone levels.

However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex, especially if you have a history of hormonal disorders or are on other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest its efficacy, more research is needed to fully understand its effects on heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><h2 id="4">4.

These compounds can help balance estrogen levels, which may contribute to more regular and lighter menstrual flow. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using milk thistle, especially for individuals with hormonal disorders or those taking other medications.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for managing heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><h2 id="6">6.

The herb contains compounds that may help strengthen the uterine muscles, promoting more controlled menstrual flow. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, scientific research on its efficacy for menstrual bleeding is still evolving, and it should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to women's health.</p><h2 id="8">8. Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus)</h2><img alt="cymbopogon citratus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/cymbopogon-citratus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cymbopogon citratus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a popular herbal tea used for its potential health benefits, including its ability to help manage excessive bleeding during menstruation.</p><p>This herb contains compounds like citral and myrcene, which have been studied for their antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties.

While some studies suggest it may support menstrual health, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using it, especially for those with underlying health conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses can vary, and it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><h2 id="10">10. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/equisetum-arvense-teas.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, is a herb that has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When used in the form of herbal tea, it may help reduce excessive bleeding during menstruation by promoting uterine tone and reducing blood flow.
