Some studies suggest that vitex may reduce the severity of menstrual cramps and shorten the duration of periods, which can indirectly help with heavy bleeding. While it is generally considered safe when used in recommended doses, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any herbal regimen, especially for those with underlying health conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>Herbal juices made from vitex agnus-castus may offer a natural alternative for managing over-bleeding, though individual responses can vary.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle juice, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest that nettle may have hemostatic properties, more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness in treating over-bleeding during menstruation.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Many women use Rosa canina juice as a natural remedy to manage excessive menstrual flow, though it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.</p><p>While preliminary research suggests possible benefits, more scientific studies are needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><h2 id="5">5. Cimicifuga racemosa</h2><img alt="cimicifuga racemosa juice" src="/images/preparations/cimicifuga-racemosa-juices.jpg"/><p>Cimicifuga racemosa, also known as black cohosh, is a commonly used herbal remedy for managing symptoms associated with menopause, including heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><p>It is believed to support hormonal balance by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, which may help regulate menstrual flow. While some studies suggest it may reduce the severity of menstrual bleeding, it is important to note that its effectiveness can vary among individuals. Herbal juices made from Cimicifuga racemosa are often taken in conjunction with other herbs to enhance their therapeutic effects.</p><p>However, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider before using this herb, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Some studies suggest that yarrow contains compounds that may influence blood clotting and hormonal balance, though more research is needed to confirm these effects.

When consumed as a juice, turmeric can be easily absorbed by the body, potentially offering faster relief compared to other forms. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using turmeric juice, especially for those with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulant medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest its benefits, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for treating over bleeding during periods.</p><h2 id="10">10.
