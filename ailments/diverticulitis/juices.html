Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a bioactive compound with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may support digestive health.</p><p>While there is limited direct research on curcuma longa herbal juices specifically for diverticulitis, some studies suggest that curcumin may help reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially alleviating symptoms associated with the condition. However, it is important to note that curcumin is poorly absorbed on its own and may require fat or black pepper extract (piperine) to enhance bioavailability. As a complementary therapy, turmeric juice may be used alongside conventional treatments under the guidance of a healthcare provider.</p><p>Nonetheless, individuals with diverticulitis should consult a physician before incorporating any herbal supplements into their regimen to ensure safety and efficacy.</p><h2 id="2">2.
