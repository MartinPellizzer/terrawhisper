It is important to note that diverticulitis requires medical management, including dietary changes, antibiotics, and sometimes surgery, rather than relying on herbal supplements alone.</p><p>Patients with diverticulitis should consult their healthcare provider before using any herbal products to ensure they do not interfere with prescribed treatments or worsen symptoms.</p><div class="toc">
