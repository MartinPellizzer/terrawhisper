alt="herbs for over bleeding during periods">
<p>Over bleeding during periods is a medical condition characterized by excessive menstrual bleeding, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances, uterine abnormalities, or other underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective approach to treating this condition, as they can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce bleeding, and alleviate symptoms such as cramping and anxiety.</p>
<p>Herbs like Crinum latifolium, Trifolium pratense, and Prunus africana have been traditionally used to treat excessive bleeding due to their astringent, anti-inflammatory, and uterine-stimulating properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as menstrual tea blends containing herbs like Angelica sinensis, Cimicifuga racemosa, and Urtica dioica, as well as capsules or tablets made from herbs like Dioscorea villosa, Tribulus terrestris, and Cuscuta chinensis, can be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding and promoting overall uterine health.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes over bleeding during periods?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of over bleeding during periods are hormonal imbalances and uterine lining issues, such as polyps or fibroids, which can disrupt the normal menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Secondary causes can include certain medical conditions like thyroid disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometriosis, as well as the use of certain medications like anticoagulants and blood thinners, which can interfere with blood clotting.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that may increase the chances of developing over bleeding during periods include a diet high in processed foods and low in essential nutrients, excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, and a sedentary lifestyle, which can all contribute to hormonal imbalances and uterine lining issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, a history of previous surgeries, such as a dilation and curettage (D&C), can also lead to over bleeding during periods due to scarring and adhesions in the uterus.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal over bleeding during periods?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat over bleeding during periods are often rich in bioactive compounds and therapeutic actions that help to regulate menstrual flow and alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>For instance, the herb Ashwagandha contains withanolides, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help to reduce menstrual cramps and heavy bleeding.</p>
<p>Additionally, the herb Dong Quai contains ferulic acid and isoflavones, which help to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce bleeding by promoting the production of clotting factors and improving uterine health.</p>
<p>Another herb, Red Clover, contains isoflavones and coumarins, which help to reduce bleeding and alleviate symptoms of heavy menstrual flow by promoting the production of thrombin and improving blood vessel integrity.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat over bleeding during periods?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat over bleeding during periods are often taken as teas or infusions, which help to reduce heavy flow by acting as a mild astringent to constrict blood vessels and reduce uterine contractions.</p>
<p>Drinking decoctions or infusions made from dried roots and leaves of certain plants can help to tone the uterine lining and reduce inflammation, thereby reducing bleeding.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations are also used to warm the lower abdomen and stimulate blood flow to the pelvic area, helping to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce heavy bleeding.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal infusions or teas are used to help the body adapt to hormonal changes and promote a balance of prostaglandins, which can help to regulate menstrual bleeding.</p>
