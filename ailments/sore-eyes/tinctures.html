When diluted properly, these tinctures can be applied as a gentle eye compress to alleviate discomfort caused by fatigue, allergies, or minor eye irritations. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using lavender tinctures on the eyes, as improper dilution or use could cause adverse reactions.</p><p>Despite its natural appeal, lavender tinctures should not replace prescribed treatments for more serious eye conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.
