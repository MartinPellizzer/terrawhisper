To prepare the tea, steep 1 teaspoon of dried yarrow in hot water for 10 minutes, then allow it to cool before using as an eyewash or compress. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using yarrow for eye conditions, as improper use can cause irritation.</p><p>Despite its historical use, there is limited scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for sore eyes, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="7">7. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/vitex-agnus-castus-teas.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its soothing properties for sore eyes.</p><p>This herb contains compounds that may help reduce inflammation and irritation, making it a popular choice for those seeking natural relief from eye discomfort.

Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a popular herbal tea known for its rich content of antioxidants, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When consumed as a tea, it can help soothe sore eyes by reducing inflammation and supporting overall eye health. The high levels of vitamin C in rosehip tea may help strengthen blood vessels and improve circulation, which can alleviate eye strain and redness. Additionally, its mild diuretic effects can help reduce fluid retention around the eyes, contributing to a reduction in puffiness.</p><p>While it is not a cure for serious eye conditions, rosa canina herbal tea can be a natural and soothing remedy for mild eye discomfort and fatigue.</p><h2 id="10">10.
