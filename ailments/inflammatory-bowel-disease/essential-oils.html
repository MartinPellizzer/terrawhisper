While some studies suggest that certain essential oils could modulate the immune system and improve gut microbiota balance, more clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety in IBD patients. These oils are typically used in aromatherapy, topical applications, or diluted oral formulations, though their use should be guided by a healthcare professional to avoid adverse interactions.</p><p>Overall, herbal essential oils may offer a natural approach to symptom relief, but they should not replace conventional medical treatments for IBD.</p><div class="toc">
