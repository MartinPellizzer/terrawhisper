Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, including alleviating symptoms of a runny nose.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, ginger can help reduce nasal congestion and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, may help stimulate circulation and clear mucus from the nasal passages. To prepare a ginger herbal juice, fresh ginger root is typically grated, blended with water or juice, and consumed warm to maximize its soothing effects.</p><p>While ginger juice can be a natural remedy for a runny nose, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Herbal juices made from fresh or dried stinging nettle leaves are often consumed as teas or tinctures, and they may support overall immune function, which could indirectly benefit individuals with allergies or colds. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle, as it may interact with certain medications or cause allergic reactions in some people.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for specific symptoms like a runny nose.</p><h2 id="7">7.
