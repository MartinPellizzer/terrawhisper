They work by providing a cooling or warming sensation that can help soothe irritated nasal passages and promote drainage. However, it is important to note that while these creams may offer temporary relief, they are not a cure for underlying causes of a runny nose, such as allergies or infections.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using herbal creams, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><div class="toc">
