The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of eucalyptus globulus help reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and combat minor infections that may contribute to a runny nose. When applied topically, these creams can offer localized relief without the systemic effects of oral medications.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for children or individuals with sensitive skin, to ensure safe and effective application.</p><h2 id="2">2. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/zingiber-officinale-creams.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, and recent research suggests that ginger-based herbal creams may offer relief for symptoms of a runny nose.</p><p>These creams typically contain essential oils and extracts from fresh or dried ginger root, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and decongestant effects. The warming sensation produced by ginger in topical applications may help to reduce nasal congestion and soothe irritated nasal passages. While some studies indicate potential benefits, more clinical trials are needed to fully confirm their efficacy for treating runny nose.</p><p>As with any topical treatment, it is advisable to perform a patch test to check for allergic reactions before using ginger herbal creams.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The aromatic compounds in rosemary may also help to clear the airways and improve breathing, making it a popular choice for those suffering from colds or allergies. However, it is important to note that while rosemary creams may offer some relief, they should not replace medical treatment for more severe or persistent nasal issues.</p><p>Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially if you have sensitive skin or underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4.

These creams may help reduce nasal congestion and soothe irritated nasal passages by promoting local healing and reducing inflammation. While they are often used as a complementary therapy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially for children or individuals with allergies.</p><p>Overall, thymus vulgaris herbal creams offer a natural alternative for managing mild nasal symptoms, though their effectiveness can vary depending on individual responses and the underlying cause of the runny nose.</p><h2 id="5">5. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/matricaria-chamomilla-creams.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a herbal ingredient often used in creams to provide natural relief for a runny nose.</p><p>These creams typically contain chamomile essential oils or extracts, which have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that can help reduce nasal irritation.

The menthol in peppermint creams works by stimulating cold receptors in the skin and nasal area, creating a sensation of relief and reducing the perception of nasal drips. While these creams may offer temporary comfort, they are not a cure for underlying causes of a runny nose, such as allergies or infections.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe symptoms.</p><h2 id="10">10. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/achillea-millefolium-creams.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, it may help soothe nasal irritation and reduce excessive mucus production associated with a runny nose.
