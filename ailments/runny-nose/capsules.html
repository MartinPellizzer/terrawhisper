Studies suggest that Echinacea may help reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms by enhancing immune response and reducing inflammation. However, the evidence for its efficacy in treating a runny nose specifically is mixed, with some research indicating potential benefits and others showing limited results.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with allergies or chronic health conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Eucalyptus globulus</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus capsule" src="/images/preparations/eucalyptus-globulus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus or gum tree, is a popular herbal remedy used in the form of capsules to alleviate symptoms of a runny nose.</p><p>These capsules contain essential oils derived from the leaves of the plant, which are known for their decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties. The active compounds in eucalyptus, such as cineole, help to reduce nasal congestion and soothe irritated nasal passages. When taken as directed, eucalyptus globulus herbal capsules can provide natural relief for individuals suffering from colds, allergies, or sinusitis.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for pregnant women, children, or those with existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The active compound, glycyrrhizin, is believed to contribute to these therapeutic effects by modulating immune responses and suppressing viral replication. However, prolonged use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances due to its effect on the adrenal glands.</p><p>As a result, it is recommended to consult a healthcare provider before using glycyrrhiza glabra capsules, especially for individuals with preexisting health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita capsule" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-capsules.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is a popular herbal remedy often used in the form of capsules to alleviate symptoms of a runny nose.</p><p>These capsules contain concentrated extracts of the peppermint plant, which is known for its cooling and decongestant properties.

Herbal capsules containing Piper nigrum are typically taken orally and are often combined with other herbs like eucalyptus or ginger to enhance their effectiveness. These capsules are a natural alternative for those seeking relief from allergic or seasonal rhinitis without the use of pharmaceutical medications.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for various hormonal and menstrual-related conditions.</p><p>While it is not primarily marketed for treating a runny nose, some individuals may use it to support overall immune function and reduce inflammation, which could indirectly help alleviate symptoms of a mild nasal congestion or runny nose. However, there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking vitex agnus-castus to the treatment of rhinitis or allergic reactions. As a herbal capsule, it is generally considered safe for most people when taken in recommended doses, though it may interact with certain medications or affect hormone levels.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using vitex agnus-castus for any medical condition, including a runny nose.</p><h2 id="10">10.
