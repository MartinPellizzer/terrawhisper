These linctuses are typically made from concentrated extracts of the plant and are often combined with other herbs or ingredients to enhance their effectiveness.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7.
