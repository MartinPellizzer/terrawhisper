While they are not a cure for colds, they may alleviate symptoms such as sore throat and congestion by soothing the respiratory tract. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, Camellia sinensis capsules can be a complementary approach to managing cold symptoms when used as part of a holistic health regimen.</p><h2 id="4">4. Thymus vulgaris</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris capsule" src="/images/preparations/thymus-vulgaris-capsules.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support the immune system and alleviate symptoms of colds.</p><p>Thymus vulgaris herbal capsules are formulated with standardized extracts of the plant, which contain potent compounds like thymol and carvacrol known for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, is a widely used herbal remedy for alleviating cold symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties.</p><p>Licorice root capsules are often taken to soothe sore throats, reduce coughing, and ease congestion by thinning mucus and promoting its expulsion from the respiratory tract. The active compounds in licorice, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, contribute to its effectiveness in supporting the immune system and reducing viral replication. However, excessive use of licorice root can lead to side effects like hypertension and fluid retention due to its mineralocorticoid-like effects.</p><p>As a result, it is recommended to use licorice root capsules under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
