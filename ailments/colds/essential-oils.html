Many people find relief by applying diluted essential oils to the chest or using them in a warm compress. However, it is important to use these oils safely, as they are highly concentrated and should never be applied directly to the skin without dilution.</p><p>While they can be a natural complement to traditional remedies, they should not replace medical treatment for severe or persistent cold symptoms.</p>
