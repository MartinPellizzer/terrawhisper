Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy traditionally used to support immune function and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is widely recognized for its potential benefits in colds and respiratory infections, its use for dysuria—painful or difficult urination—has been explored in some herbal medicine practices.
