These essential oils can help reduce plaque formation and neutralize acids that erode tooth enamel, promoting a healthier oral environment. When used in conjunction with proper oral hygiene practices, they may offer a complementary approach to conventional dental care.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a dental professional before using essential oils, as some may cause irritation or interact with other treatments.</p>
