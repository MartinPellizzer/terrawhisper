<p>Herbal teas for tooth decay are a natural and holistic approach to treating and preventing tooth decay, which is a bacterial infection that causes demineralization of tooth enamel.</p>
<p>These teas are rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and antimicrobial properties that help to combat the bacteria causing tooth decay, reduce inflammation, and promote oral health.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal teas that can be used to treat tooth decay include peppermint tea, which has antibacterial properties that help to kill Streptococcus mutans bacteria; chamomile tea, which soothes and calms the gums; eucalyptus tea, which has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce plaque and prevent further decay; and calendula tea, which promotes oral health and reduces inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas like sage, licorice root, and rosemary tea can also be used to treat tooth decay due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
