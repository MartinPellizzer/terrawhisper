Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/mentha-piperita-teas.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal teas for its refreshing and therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is not a cure for tooth decay, peppermint tea may help reduce oral bacteria that contribute to plaque and cavities. The minty aroma and cooling effect of the tea can stimulate saliva production, which helps neutralize acids in the mouth. Some studies suggest that menthol, a compound found in peppermint, may have mild antimicrobial effects that could support oral health.</p><p>However, it is important to note that peppermint tea should not replace regular dental care, including brushing, flossing, and professional check-ups.</p><h2 id="10">10.
