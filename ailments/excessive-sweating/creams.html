Herbal creams containing Hypericum perforatum may contain compounds like hyperforin and hypericin, which are believed to have anticholinergic and anti-inflammatory properties that could help manage hyperhidrosis. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for excessive sweating is limited, and individuals should consult a healthcare provider before using such products.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, potential side effects and interactions with other medications must be carefully considered.</p><h2 id="2">2.
