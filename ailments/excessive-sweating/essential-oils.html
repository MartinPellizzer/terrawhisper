Some studies suggest that certain essential oils may influence the nervous system, potentially reducing the body's stress response, which is a common trigger for excessive sweating. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or underlying health conditions.</p><p>While they may offer complementary benefits, essential oils should not replace medical treatments for severe cases of hyperhidrosis.</p>
