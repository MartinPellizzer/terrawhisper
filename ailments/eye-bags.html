<p>Eye bags is a common condition characterized by the appearance of dark circles or puffiness under the eyes, often caused by fatigue, allergies, or fluid retention.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have become increasingly popular in treating eye bags due to their natural and non-invasive approach, offering several benefits such as reducing inflammation, improving circulation, and promoting relaxation.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like chamomile, lavender, and peppermint are known to calm and soothe the skin around the eyes, while others like ginger, turmeric, and ginkgo biloba help to reduce puffiness and improve lymphatic drainage.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like eye creams infused with extracts of green tea, rosehip, and alfalfa, as well as herbal teas such as licorice root and dandelion, can be used to treat eye bags, with the former providing antioxidant and moisturizing benefits, and the latter aiding in the removal of toxins and excess fluids.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes eye bags?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of eye bags are poor sleep quality, lack of hydration, and genetics, which can lead to fluid accumulation and puffiness under the eyes.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include allergies, sinus infections, and hormonal changes, as these conditions can cause inflammation and swelling.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing eye bags include irregular sleep schedules, a diet high in salt and processed foods, and prolonged periods of screen time, as these factors can exacerbate fluid retention and disrupt sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Additionally, stress and smoking can also contribute to eye bags due to increased blood pressure and inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal eye bags?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat eye bags are rich in bioactive compounds that address the underlying causes of this condition, including inflammation, dark circles, and puffiness.</p>
<p>Examples of herbs that exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, such as chamomile and calendula, can help reduce swelling and soothe the delicate skin around the eyes.</p>
<p>Herbs like ginkgo biloba and green tea are rich in flavonoids and antioxidants, which can help improve circulation and reduce the appearance of dark circles.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbs like peony and licorice root have been traditionally used to treat eye bags due to their ability to balance the body's fluids and promote lymphatic drainage.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat eye bags?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat eye bags are often in the form of teas and infusions, which help to reduce puffiness and promote relaxation.</p>
<p>Soothing eye baths made from herbal decoctions can also be used to calm the skin and reduce the appearance of dark circles.</p>
<p>Herbal compresses, such as those made from a combination of astringent and anti-inflammatory properties, can be applied to the eyes to constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbal tonics and essences can be used to nourish and moisturize the delicate skin around the eyes, helping to prevent future occurrences of eye bags.</p>
