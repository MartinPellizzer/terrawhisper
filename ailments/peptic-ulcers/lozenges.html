Peppermint contains compounds like menthol that may help reduce stomach acid secretion and ease gastrointestinal discomfort. However, while some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating peptic ulcers specifically.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from ginger are often recommended to alleviate symptoms associated with peptic ulcers due to their ability to reduce gastric acid secretion and enhance mucosal defense. These lozenges may help soothe the lining of the stomach and duodenum, promoting healing of ulcers.

However, while preliminary studies show promise, more clinical research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety in treating this condition.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using Curcuma longa lozenges, especially if taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and mucoprotective properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from Glycyrrhiza glabra are often used to soothe the lining of the stomach and reduce irritation associated with peptic ulcers. These lozenges contain glycyrrhizin, a compound that may help inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of ulcers. However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under medical supervision.</p><p>Despite these considerations, Glycyrrhiza glabra lozenges remain a popular complementary therapy for managing symptoms of peptic ulcers.</p><h2 id="5">5.

These lozenges are believed to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce gastric irritation and inflammation. While some studies suggest cumin's ability to inhibit harmful bacteria like Helicobacter pylori, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating peptic ulcers.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, cumin lozenges may be considered alongside standard medical treatments under professional guidance.</p><h2 id="6">6. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing silybum marianum are formulated to support gastrointestinal health and may aid in the healing of peptic ulcers by reducing stomach acid and promoting mucosal repair.

Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare lozenge" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic effects on digestive health.</p><p>Fennel herbal lozenges are often formulated to support the healing of peptic ulcers by promoting the secretion of digestive enzymes and reducing gastric acid production. The active compounds in fennel, such as anethol and fenchone, may help soothe the lining of the stomach and intestines, alleviating symptoms like pain and inflammation. While preliminary studies suggest possible benefits, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using fennel lozenges as a treatment for ulcers, as they should not replace conventional medical therapies.</p><p>These lozenges may be used as a complementary approach to support overall digestive wellness under proper guidance.</p><h2 id="9">9. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus lozenge" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential gastrointestinal benefits.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with hormonal balance, some studies suggest it may possess anti-ulcer properties due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Herbal lozenges containing Vitex agnus-castus are sometimes used as a complementary therapy for peptic ulcers, though they are not a primary treatment. These lozenges may help soothe the mucous membranes of the digestive tract, potentially reducing irritation and promoting healing.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, as they should not replace standard medical treatments for ulcers.</p><h2 id="10">10.
