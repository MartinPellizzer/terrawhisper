Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/cnicus-benedictus-creams.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thorn, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to address joint stiffness and related inflammatory conditions.</p><p>The plant contains bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and tannins, which are believed to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.

While comfrey is valued for its traditional use in herbal medicine, it is important to note that the roots of the plant contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic if absorbed through the skin over prolonged periods. As a result, many modern formulations use only the leaves, which are considered safer, and it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p><p>Despite these precautions, Symphytum officinale herbal creams remain a popular natural remedy for those seeking relief from joint stiffness and related discomfort.</p>
