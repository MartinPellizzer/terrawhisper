Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, herbal lozenges are generally considered safer with fewer side effects, making them an attractive option for many individuals. However, their effectiveness can vary, and it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.</p><p>While they may offer some relief, herbal lozenges should not replace professional medical advice or treatment for severe joint conditions.</p>
