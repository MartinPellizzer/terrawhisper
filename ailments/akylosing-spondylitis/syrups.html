The active compounds in the syrup, such as tanshinone and salvianolic acid, help to reduce joint inflammation and alleviate pain associated with the condition. While more clinical research is needed, some patients report improved mobility and reduced stiffness when incorporating this herbal syrup into their treatment regimen.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Salvia miltiorrhiza syrup may support conventional treatments, but it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="5">5. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea syrup" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, has been traditionally used for its immune-boosting properties, and some studies suggest it may have anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>While primarily used to support immune function and reduce the duration of colds, its potential role in managing inflammation associated with ankylosing spondylitis has garnered interest among researchers and alternative medicine practitioners. Echinacea herbal syrups are often made from the dried flowers and roots of the plant and are available in various formulations, typically containing additional herbs or immune-supporting ingredients. Although there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking echinacea to improved outcomes in ankylosing spondylitis, some patients report reduced joint pain and stiffness when using it as a complementary therapy.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating echinacea into a treatment plan for ankylosing spondylitis.</p><h2 id="6">6. Withania somnifera</h2><img alt="withania somnifera syrup" src="/images/preparations/withania-somnifera-syrups.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its adaptogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that ashwagandha herbal syrups may offer potential benefits for individuals with ankylosing spondylitis by reducing inflammation and pain in the joints.

Studies suggest that the active compound thymoquinone in Nigella sativa may inhibit inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress, which are key factors in ankylosing spondylitis. While anecdotal evidence supports its use, more clinical research is needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety in managing the disease.</p><p>Nonetheless, many patients find it beneficial as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments.</p><h2 id="8">8. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum syrup" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>While primarily recognized for its liver-protecting effects, some studies suggest that silybum marianum may offer benefits for inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis due to its ability to modulate immune responses and reduce oxidative stress. Herbal syrups made from silybum marianum are often consumed as a natural supplement to support joint health and alleviate symptoms associated with chronic inflammation. However, more clinical research is needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for managing ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p>As with any herbal treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating silybum marianum syrup into a treatment plan.</p><h2 id="9">9. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica syrup" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-syrups.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from Urtica dioica are often utilized in the management of ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine.

Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra syrup" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-syrups.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from Glycyrrhiza glabra are often prepared by extracting the roots with water or alcohol to retain bioactive compounds such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids. These syrups may help alleviate symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis by reducing joint inflammation and modulating the immune response. However, long-term use of licorice syrup can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances due to its corticosteroid-like effects.</p><p>Therefore, while it may offer some symptomatic relief, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>
