Some studies suggest that aloe vera juice could support gut health, which is increasingly recognized as a factor in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While more research is needed to confirm its efficacy, many individuals with ankylosing spondylitis use aloe-based products as a complementary therapy.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating aloe juice into a treatment regimen to ensure safety and appropriateness.</p><h2 id="6">6. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>Some studies suggest that consuming urtica dioica herbal juices may help reduce inflammation and pain associated with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine.
