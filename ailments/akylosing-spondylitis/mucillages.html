In the context of ankylosing spondylitis, they may help alleviate symptoms by supporting joint health and reducing inflammatory responses. While research on their efficacy for this specific condition is limited, some studies suggest that they may complement conventional treatments.</p><p>As with any natural remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating herbal mucillages into a treatment plan for ankylosing spondylitis.</p><div class="toc">
