Herbal baths incorporating silybum marianum are sometimes used as a complementary therapy for hematuria, aiming to soothe inflammation and promote healing in the urinary system. However, scientific evidence directly linking silybum marianum baths to the reduction of hematuria is limited, and more clinical studies are needed to validate its efficacy.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using silybum marianum, especially for individuals with underlying medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.

However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using blessed thistle, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports its use, more scientific research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating hematuria.</p><h2 id="8">8. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/baths/salvia-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory and astringent effects.</p><p>Some historical and alternative medical sources suggest that sage may be beneficial in reducing hematuria, or blood in the urine, by promoting urinary tract health and reducing inflammation. While there is limited clinical evidence supporting its use for hematuria specifically, some studies indicate that sage may help in reducing urinary tract infections, which can be a contributing factor to hematuria. Herbal baths infused with sage are believed to help soothe the urinary tract and reduce irritation, potentially alleviating symptoms associated with hematuria.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage baths or any herbal remedy, especially if hematuria is a symptom of a more serious underlying condition.</p><h2 id="9">9.
