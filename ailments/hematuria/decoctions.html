These decoctions work by supporting kidney function, reducing urinary tract irritation, and promoting the elimination of toxins from the body. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies, as they may interact with medications or exacerbate certain conditions.</p><p>While herbal decoctions can be a complementary approach, they should not replace conventional medical treatment for hematuria.</p><div class="toc">
