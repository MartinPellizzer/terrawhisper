While some studies suggest that certain herbs may help reduce urinary tract infections that can lead to hematuria, more rigorous clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety. Herbal lozenges are generally considered safe for short-term use, but individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using them, especially if they have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>It is important to note that herbal lozenges should not replace medical treatment for hematuria, which can be a symptom of more serious underlying conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">1. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/urtica-dioica-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.</p><p>Urtica dioica herbal lozenges are formulated to support urinary tract health and may help alleviate symptoms associated with hematuria, or blood in the urine. These lozenges typically contain a concentrated extract of the plant, which is believed to promote kidney function and reduce irritation in the urinary tract. While some studies suggest that stinging nettle may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it for hematuria, as underlying causes should be properly diagnosed.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Urtica dioica lozenges may offer supportive benefits, but they should not replace conventional medical treatment.</p><h2 id="2">2. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/equisetum-arvense-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its high silica content and potential diuretic properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from Equisetum arvense are sometimes used to support urinary tract health and may aid in the management of hematuria, or blood in the urine.

However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Equisetum arvense lozenges, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects in certain individuals.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of Equisetum arvense for treating hematuria.</p><h2 id="3">3. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/hypericum-perforatum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its use in treating mild depression, some studies suggest that its active compounds, such as hypericin and hyperforin, may have beneficial effects on urinary tract health. Hypericum perforatum herbal lozenges are sometimes used as a complementary therapy for hematuria, or blood in the urine, due to their potential to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the urinary tract. However, it is important to note that there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for hematuria, and it should not replace conventional medical treatment.</p><p>Patients should consult with a healthcare provider before using hypericum perforatum lozenges, especially if they are on other medications, due to potential interactions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Sanguisorba (Sanguisorba officinalis)</h2><img alt="sanguisorba officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/sanguisorba-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Sanguisorba officinalis herbal lozenges are traditionally used in herbal medicine to support urinary tract health and address conditions like hematuria, which is the presence of blood in urine.</p><p>These lozenges are derived from the roots of the sanguisorba plant, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The active compounds in sanguisorba officinalis may help reduce irritation and inflammation in the urinary tract, potentially alleviating symptoms associated with hematuria. While not a substitute for medical treatment, these lozenges may offer complementary support for individuals experiencing mild urinary tract issues.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies, especially if hematuria is a symptom of an underlying condition.</p><h2 id="5">5. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/cnicus-benedictus-lozenges.jpg"/><p>CNICUS BENEDICTUS herbal lozenges are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential therapeutic effects on urinary tract health.</p><p>These lozenges are formulated with CNICUS BENEDICTUS, a plant known for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which may support the treatment of hematuria, or blood in the urine. The lozenges are designed to dissolve in the mouth, allowing the active compounds to be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, potentially exerting a soothing and healing effect on the urinary tract. While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, they may offer complementary support in managing symptoms associated with hematuria.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if underlying conditions or medications are involved.</p><h2 id="6">6. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/salvia-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from salvia officinalis may help reduce inflammation in the urinary tract, potentially alleviating symptoms associated with hematuria.

These lozenges are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for urinary tract infections and related conditions.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using sage lozenges, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/silybum-marianum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, has been traditionally used for its hepatoprotective properties, and its herbal lozenges may offer potential benefits for individuals experiencing hematuria, or blood in the urine.</p><p>The active compound, silymarin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that could support urinary tract health and reduce irritation or inflammation contributing to hematuria. While there is limited direct scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum lozenges to the treatment of hematuria, some studies suggest that its overall supportive role in kidney and liver function may indirectly aid in managing related symptoms. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these lozenges, as hematuria can be a symptom of more serious underlying conditions.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, silybum marianum lozenges may be considered alongside conventional medical treatments for a holistic approach to urinary health.</p><h2 id="8">8. Plantain (Plantago lanceolata)</h2><img alt="plantago lanceolata lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/plantago-lanceolata-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Plantago lanceolata, commonly known as plantain, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from Plantago lanceolata are believed to support urinary tract health and may help reduce symptoms associated with hematuria, which is the presence of blood in urine.

While some studies suggest that Plantago lanceolata may have a protective effect on the urinary tract, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy in treating hematuria.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if hematuria is a symptom of an underlying medical condition.</p><h2 id="9">9. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/achillea-millefolium-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and hemostatic properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing Achillea millefolium may be used to support urinary tract health and help manage hematuria, or blood in the urine, by potentially reducing inflammation and promoting healing of the urinary tract lining. While some studies suggest that yarrow may help in reducing bleeding due to its astringent effects, it is important to note that its efficacy for hematuria specifically has not been widely scientifically validated. As with any herbal remedy, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially when dealing with a condition like hematuria, which can indicate underlying health issues.</p><p>Patients should also be cautious about potential interactions with other medications and should not replace conventional medical treatment with herbal remedies alone.</p><h2 id="10">10. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina lozenge" src="/images/preparations/lozenges/rosa-canina-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina herbal lozenges are traditionally used in herbal medicine to support urinary tract health and may help alleviate symptoms associated with hematuria, which is the presence of blood in urine.</p><p>These lozenges are derived from the rosehip, which is rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, and other bioactive compounds known to promote healing and reduce inflammation.
