<p>Oily hair is a common condition characterized by an excessive production of sebum, leading to a greasy, oily texture and a strong odor.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to treat oily hair, offering a natural and chemical-free solution that not only controls oil production but also nourishes and balances the scalp.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Neem, Tea Tree, and Rosemary have been used to treat oily hair due to their antifungal and antibacterial properties, which help to control the growth of microorganisms that contribute to oil buildup.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like Neem oil shampoos, Rosemary essential oil scalp treatments, and herbal infusions like Green tea and Sage have been used to treat oily hair, as they help to regulate oil production, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp growth.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes oily hair?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of oily hair are overactive sebaceous glands and hormonal imbalances, particularly an increase in androgens such as testosterone, which stimulate the glands to produce more sebum.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include using heavy hair products, not washing hair regularly enough, and using hot water, as it strips the hair of its natural oils but also causes the glands to produce more.</p>
<p>A lifestyle that increases the chances of developing oily hair includes consuming a diet high in processed foods and sugar, as it can lead to hormonal imbalances, as well as not maintaining good hygiene and using harsh hair products.</p>
<p>Additionally, people with a sedentary lifestyle or those who experience high levels of stress may also be more prone to oily hair due to the body's natural response to these conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal oily hair?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat oily hair are Neem (Azadirachta indica), Amla (Emblica officinalis), and Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), which have been traditionally used to control scalp oiliness.</p>
<p>Neem exhibits therapeutic actions such as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which help to reduce dandruff and soothe an itchy scalp, while Amla's antioxidant properties help to protect the scalp from damage.</p>
<p>Rosemary, on the other hand, has been found to stimulate hair growth and improve circulation, thereby reducing oil production.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in these herbs, including nimbin in Neem, ascorbic acid in Amla, and rosmarinic acid in Rosemary, are responsible for their therapeutic effects in treating oily hair.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat oily hair?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat oily hair are teas, infusions, and rinses that help balance the scalp's natural oil production.</p>
<p>Some of these preparations include cooled down infusions used as final rinses, teas that are consumed internally to improve digestion and reduce oil buildup, and hot infusions applied as a scalp treatment to open up the pores and draw out excess oil.</p>
<p>Rinses made by steeping certain ingredients in hot water can also be used as a treatment to absorb excess oil and purify the scalp.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations can be applied directly to the hair and scalp as a mask or leave-in treatment to help control oil production and add shine to the hair.</p>
