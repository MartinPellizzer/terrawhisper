<p>Gum swelling, also known as gingival hyperplasia, is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the gums due to inflammation or infection, often causing discomfort and pain.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective approach to treating gum swelling, providing numerous benefits such as reduced inflammation, improved oral health, and minimized risk of complications.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like aloe vera, chamomile, and calendula are used to treat gum swelling due to their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, which help to soothe and calm the affected area.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as aloe vera gel, chamomile tea, and calendula oil can be used topically or taken internally to treat gum swelling, with aloe vera gel being particularly effective in reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing, chamomile tea helping to calm the gums and reduce pain, and calendula oil providing antiseptic properties to prevent infection.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes gum swelling?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of gum swelling are bacterial infections, such as periodontitis, and allergic reactions to certain substances, including food and dental materials.</p>
<p>Secondary causes may include poor oral hygiene, smoking, and grinding or clenching the teeth, as these factors can exacerbate existing conditions.</p>
<p>Individuals with a sedentary lifestyle, consuming high-sugar diets, and engaging in stress-induced habits, such as nail biting or teeth grinding, are more likely to develop gum swelling due to increased inflammation and pressure on the gums.</p>
<p>Additionally, people with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, may be more susceptible to gum swelling due to compromised healing processes.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal gum swelling?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat gum swelling are Aloe vera, Echinacea, and Calendula, which have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that help reduce swelling and prevent infection.</p>
<p>Aloe vera contains bioactive compounds such as aloin and aloe-emodin, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial actions that soothe and protect the gum tissue.</p>
<p>Echinacea, on the other hand, contains compounds like echinacoside and isobutylamides that have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects, helping to reduce swelling and promote healing.</p>
<p>Calendula's triterpenoid saponins also exhibit anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making it an effective herb in treating gum swelling.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat gum swelling?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat gum swelling are often made into teas, infusions, or tinctures that have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>Drinking a warm infusion made from a plant known for its ability to reduce swelling can help alleviate discomfort and pain in the affected area.</p>
<p>Certain herbal preparations, such as mouthwashes or gargles, can be used to disinfect and soothe the gums, while others, like topical creams or ointments, can be applied directly to the swollen area to reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>These preparations can be used in combination with good oral hygiene practices to promote healing and prevent further irritation.</p>
