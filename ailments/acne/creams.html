Aloe vera contains compounds that can help reduce redness, swelling, and scarring associated with acne breakouts. Its ability to moisturize the skin without clogging pores makes it a suitable ingredient for sensitive or acne-prone skin.</p><p>When used consistently, aloe-based creams may support clearer skin by promoting healing and maintaining a balanced skin environment.</p><h2 id="2">2.
