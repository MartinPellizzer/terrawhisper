While some studies suggest that St. John's Wort may help regulate sebum production and reduce inflammation, its effectiveness for acne is still being explored in clinical research. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with certain medications.</p><p>When prepared as a tea, it is typically consumed in small doses and may be used as a complementary approach to conventional acne treatments.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Chamomile tea can be applied topically or consumed internally to support overall skin health and reduce breakouts. Its soothing effects may also help alleviate redness and irritation often linked to acne-prone skin.</p><p>However, individuals with allergies to ragweed or related plants should use chamomile with caution, as it may trigger adverse reactions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbal plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its various health benefits.</p><p>When used in the form of herbal tea, stinging nettle may help support skin health and potentially reduce acne due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tea is believed to help detoxify the body and balance hormonal levels, which can contribute to acne formation. It is often recommended as a natural alternative for those seeking to manage mild to moderate acne without the side effects of conventional treatments.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating stinging nettle tea into a skincare routine, especially for those with existing health conditions or allergies.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Drinking sage tea or applying it topically can potentially help balance sebum production and soothe irritated skin. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage for acne, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest promising results, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for acne treatment.</p><h2 id="5">5.

When consumed as a tea, vitex agnus-castus may help calm the skin by reducing excess sebum production and inflammation. It is typically recommended for women experiencing acne related to hormonal fluctuations, such as during menstrual cycles or menopause.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex agnus-castus, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support skin health and treat acne.</p><p>The flowers and fruits of the Rosa canina plant are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory compounds, which can help reduce inflammation and redness associated with acne. When brewed into a tea, Rosa canina may help regulate sebum production and promote a clearer complexion by supporting the body's natural detoxification processes. It is often combined with other herbs like nettle or chamomile to enhance its skin-soothing properties.</p><p>While it is generally considered safe, individuals with allergies to roses should consult a healthcare professional before using Rosa canina herbal tea for acne.</p><h2 id="7">7. Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, contains bioactive compounds such as catechins, polyphenols, and antioxidants that have been studied for their potential benefits in managing acne.</p><p>These compounds may help reduce inflammation and sebum production, both of which are key factors in the development of acne. Herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis, such as green tea, are often recommended as natural remedies due to their mild and soothing properties. Regular consumption of these teas may support skin health by promoting detoxification and balancing internal systems.</p><p>However, while some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand their efficacy in treating acne.</p><h2 id="8">8. English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/lavandula-angustifolia-teas.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is widely used in herbal teas for its soothing and therapeutic properties.</p><p>This plant contains compounds like linalool and linalyl acetate, which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects that may help reduce acne-causing bacteria on the skin. Drinking lavender tea can promote relaxation and reduce stress, which is a known contributor to acne flare-ups. Additionally, the mild antiseptic properties of lavender may help in clearing up blemishes and improving skin texture.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using lavender tea, especially if you have sensitive skin or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="9">9. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/chamomilla-recutita-teas.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is a popular herbal tea used for its potential benefits in managing acne.</p><p>This herb contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can help reduce redness, swelling, and bacterial growth associated with acne.

Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal teas to support skin health and potentially help with acne.</p><p>The gel extracted from the aloe plant contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may help reduce redness, swelling, and bacterial growth associated with acne.

Some studies suggest that aloe vera may help regulate sebum production and reduce the formation of comedones.</p><p>However, it is important to note that while aloe vera tea may offer some benefits for acne-prone skin, it should be used as part of a holistic skincare routine and not as a standalone treatment.</p>
