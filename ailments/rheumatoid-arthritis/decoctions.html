While some studies suggest that these natural remedies may help reduce joint inflammation and pain, their efficacy varies and is often supported by anecdotal evidence rather than extensive clinical trials. It is important for individuals to consult with healthcare professionals before using herbal decoctions as part of their treatment plan, especially since they may interact with conventional medications.</p><p>Despite their historical use, herbal decoctions should not replace prescribed medical treatments but may be considered as complementary therapies under proper guidance.</p><div class="toc">
