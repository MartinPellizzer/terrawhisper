<h2 id="1">1. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis herbal capsules are commonly used to support the healing of open wounds due to their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These capsules contain dried and powdered calendula flowers, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing and regenerative effects. The active compounds in calendula, such as flavonoids and triterpenes, may help reduce swelling, prevent infection, and promote tissue repair. While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, calendula capsules can be a complementary therapy for minor wounds when used under professional guidance.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using calendula for more severe or chronic wounds to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><h2 id="2">2. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis capsule" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal capsules to support the healing of open wounds due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These capsules provide a convenient and concentrated form of aloe vera gel, which can be applied directly to the affected area or taken orally to enhance the body's natural healing processes. The active compounds in aloe vera, such as polysaccharides and enzymes, help reduce inflammation, promote cell regeneration, and prevent infection in wounds. Clinical studies suggest that aloe vera may accelerate wound closure and improve skin texture, making it a popular complementary therapy in wound care.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using aloe vera capsules, especially for severe or chronic wounds, to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Herbal capsules containing Hypericum perforatum may be used adjunctively in wound care, but they should not replace standard medical treatments for serious or infected wounds. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with various medications and may not be suitable for all individuals.</p><p>Overall, while Hypericum perforatum may offer some supportive benefits for minor wounds, it should be used cautiously and under medical guidance.</p><h2 id="4">4. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support wound healing and promote tissue repair.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it provides a convenient and standardized way to incorporate its beneficial properties into one's wellness routine.

These capsules are often recommended for individuals with open wounds, as they may aid in preventing infection and accelerating recovery.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Cnicus benedictus, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to support the immune system and promote healing.</p><p>While it is more frequently associated with colds and respiratory infections, some studies suggest that echinacea may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that could potentially aid in the healing of open wounds. However, it is important to note that echinacea herbal capsules are not a substitute for standard wound care practices, such as cleaning and dressing the wound. When considering echinacea for wound healing, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure it is safe and appropriate for the individual's condition.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating open wounds.</p><h2 id="6">6. Centella asiatica</h2><img alt="centella asiatica capsule" src="/images/preparations/centella-asiatica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Centella asiatica herbal capsules are traditionally used to support the healing of open wounds due to their rich content of active compounds like asiatic acid and madecassol, which promote tissue regeneration and collagen synthesis.</p><p>These capsules are often recommended for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help reduce swelling and prevent infection in wounds. The herb has been used in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine for centuries to enhance wound healing and improve skin integrity. Modern research suggests that Centella asiatica may accelerate the healing process by stimulating cell proliferation and improving microcirculation.</p><p>As a natural supplement, it is generally considered safe, though individuals should consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if they are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement that has been traditionally used for its potential healing properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it may support the healing of open wounds by promoting tissue regeneration and reducing inflammation.

Arnica montana</h2><img alt="arnica montana capsule" src="/images/preparations/arnica-montana-capsules.jpg"/><p>Arnica montana herbal capsules are commonly used to support the healing of open wounds due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>The active compounds in arnica, such as helenalin and other sesquiterpene lactones, are believed to reduce swelling, bruising, and pain associated with injuries.
