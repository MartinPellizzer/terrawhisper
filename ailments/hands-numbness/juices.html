<h2 id="1">1. Ginkgo biloba</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba juice" src="/images/preparations/ginkgo-biloba-juices.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal juices are often used to support circulation and may help alleviate numbness in the hands by improving blood flow to the extremities.</p><p>This herb is known for its ability to enhance microcirculation and promote the dilation of blood vessels, which can be beneficial for individuals experiencing peripheral neuropathy or poor circulation. While some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may have neuroprotective properties, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for numbness specifically. It is typically consumed in capsule or liquid form, and some people prefer the juice for its natural potency and ease of absorption.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including alleviating numbness in the hands.</p><p>The plant contains various bioactive compounds such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may support nerve function and circulation. Herbal juices made from fresh or dried stinging nettle leaves are often prepared by blending them with water or other herbal ingredients to enhance absorption. Some people use these juices as a natural remedy to reduce tingling and numbness caused by conditions like peripheral neuropathy or poor circulation.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle juice, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in supporting hormonal balance and nerve health.</p><p>Some herbal practitioners suggest that vitex agnus-castus may help alleviate numbness in the hands by promoting better circulation and reducing inflammation. While scientific evidence specifically linking vitex to hand numbness is limited, its calming and anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to overall nerve function improvement. When considering vitex agnus-castus herbal juices, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>As part of a holistic approach, vitex may complement other treatments for hand numbness, though it should not replace medical advice or prescribed therapies.</p><h2 id="4">4. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains a bioactive compound called curcumin, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Some research suggests that curcumin may help reduce nerve inflammation and improve circulation, potentially offering relief for numbness in the hands. However, while turmeric is often used in herbal juices and supplements, its effectiveness for nerve-related conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome or neuropathy remains inconclusive. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using turmeric-based remedies, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><p>Incorporating turmeric into a balanced diet or using it in herbal juices may support overall health, but it should not replace medical treatment for neurological conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While scientific research on its direct effects on numbness in the hands is limited, some studies suggest that sage may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory benefits. Herbal juices made from fresh or dried sage leaves are often consumed to support overall nervous system health. These juices may help improve circulation and reduce oxidative stress, which could indirectly alleviate symptoms of numbness.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage or any herbal remedy for medical conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea juice" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-juices.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support immune function, but it has also been explored for its potential benefits in alleviating numbness in the hands.</p><p>Some preliminary studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of echinacea may help reduce nerve irritation and improve circulation, which could contribute to easing hand numbness. While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking echinacea to the treatment of hand numbness, some individuals report anecdotal relief when using echinacea-based herbal juices. It is important to note that echinacea should not replace medical treatment for underlying conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating echinacea into a treatment regimen for numbness.</p><h2 id="7">7. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including support for liver function.</p><p>While it is most well-known for its role in liver health, some studies suggest that silybum marianum may also have properties that could help alleviate numbness in the hands, possibly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These properties may help reduce nerve irritation or inflammation that contributes to tingling or numbness. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to the treatment of hand numbness is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in this context.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits, making it a popular ingredient in herbal juices aimed at alleviating numbness in the hands.</p><p>These juices often combine fresh ginger with other herbs like turmeric, garlic, and lemon to enhance their therapeutic effects. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, may help improve blood flow and reduce nerve inflammation, which can contribute to hand numbness. Regular consumption of ginger-based herbal juices may support overall nerve health and circulation, potentially offering relief for conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome or poor circulation.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these juices as a treatment, especially for persistent or severe numbness.</p><h2 id="9">9. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium juice" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-juices.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is primarily recognized for its ability to reduce inflammation and promote wound healing, some preliminary studies suggest it may also support nerve health. When prepared as a herbal juice, achillea millefolium is believed to help alleviate numbness in the hands by improving circulation and reducing oxidative stress. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking yarrow juice to numbness relief in the hands is limited.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using achillea millefolium, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.

While there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking rhodiola rosea to hand numbness, its overall health benefits have led to its inclusion in various herbal juices aimed at supporting nervous system function. When consumed as part of a balanced diet, rhodiola rosea herbal juices may offer supportive benefits, though they should not replace medical treatment for underlying neurological conditions.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating rhodiola rosea into one's regimen, especially for those with existing health concerns.</p>
