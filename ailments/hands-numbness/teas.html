<p>Herbal teas for numbness in hands are natural remedies used to treat a condition characterized by a loss of sensation or feeling in the hands, often due to nerve damage, poor circulation, or certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>These teas are beneficial in treating numbness in hands as they promote blood flow, reduce inflammation, and provide antioxidant properties that help to repair damaged nerves and improve overall circulation.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal teas that can be used to treat numbness in hands include Ginger tea, which helps to increase blood flow and reduce pain; Turmeric tea, which contains curcumin that reduces inflammation and promotes healing; Peppermint tea, which improves circulation and reduces numbness; Ginkgo Biloba tea, which enhances blood flow and improves nerve function; and Rosemary tea, which improves circulation and reduces inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as Ashwagandha, Cinnamon, and Lavender tea can also be used to treat numbness in hands due to their ability to reduce stress, improve circulation, and promote relaxation.</p>

According to "Current drug discovery technologies", teas for numbness in hands may be relieved by drinking green tea, which contains Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound that helps suppress inflammation and oxidative stress to provide pain relief.
