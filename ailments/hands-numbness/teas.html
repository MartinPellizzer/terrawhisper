While some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba might offer neuroprotective benefits, its effectiveness for numbness specifically is still under investigation. It is generally considered safe when consumed in moderate amounts, though it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using ginkgo biloba for persistent or severe numbness.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While there is limited direct scientific evidence linking vitex to hand numbness specifically, its use in managing hormonal imbalances may indirectly support nerve health and circulation. Herbal teas made from vitex are often consumed for their calming properties and are sometimes recommended as a complementary therapy for neurological symptoms.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially if experiencing persistent numbness or other neurological symptoms.</p><h2 id="3">3.

While scientific evidence is limited, some studies suggest that sage may help regulate nerve function and reduce oxidative stress, which can contribute to neuropathy. Herbal teas made from dried sage leaves are often consumed warm to promote absorption of its active compounds.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage for numbness, as it may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5.
