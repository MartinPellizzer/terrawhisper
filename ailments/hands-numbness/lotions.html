<h2 id="1">1. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum lotion" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-lotions.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild depression, it has also been explored for its possible benefits in alleviating numbness in the hands, often associated with conditions like neuropathy or repetitive strain injuries. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in St. John's wort, such as hyperforin and hypericin, may have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects that could help reduce nerve-related discomfort. Hypericum perforatum herbal lotions are formulated to deliver these compounds topically, offering a localized treatment that may help improve circulation and reduce tingling or numbness.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using such products, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These lotions may be applied topically to the affected areas to promote blood flow and reduce discomfort. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting echinacea's effectiveness for nerve-related numbness is limited, and individuals should consult with a healthcare professional before using such products.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, potential side effects and interactions with other medications should be carefully considered.</p><h2 id="6">6. Ginkgo biloba</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba lotion" src="/images/preparations/ginkgo-biloba-lotions.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal lotions are formulated with extracts from the leaves of the ginkgo tree, which is known for its potential to improve blood circulation and cognitive function.</p><p>These lotions are often used to alleviate numbness in the hands, particularly in individuals experiencing poor circulation or nerve-related issues. The active compounds in ginkgo biloba, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, are believed to enhance microcirculation and reduce oxidative stress, which may help in restoring sensation.

Arnica montana</h2><img alt="arnica montana lotion" src="/images/preparations/arnica-montana-lotions.jpg"/><p>Arnica montana herbal lotions are commonly used to alleviate numbness in the hands by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation.</p><p>These lotions contain a concentrated form of the Arnica montana plant, which is known for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. When applied topically to the affected area, the lotion may help stimulate blood flow and ease discomfort associated with numbness.

Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense lotion" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-lotions.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for its potential benefits in alleviating numbness in the hands.</p><p>This plant is rich in silica and other minerals, which may support nerve function and circulation, making it a popular ingredient in herbal lotions designed for neurological and circulatory support.
