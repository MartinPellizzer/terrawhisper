When used as a herbal decoction, it is typically prepared by simmering the dried berries in water for several hours, and the resulting infusion is consumed daily.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
