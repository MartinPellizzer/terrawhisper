Studies suggest that regular consumption of vitex tea may improve hormonal imbalances and reduce the severity of PMS symptoms in some women.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any herbal regimen, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
