<h2 id="1">1. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its use in treating mild depression, some studies suggest it may have beneficial effects in reducing inflammation and fighting bacterial infections. When used in the form of capsules, Hypericum perforatum may support the body's natural defenses against ear infections by inhibiting the growth of pathogens. However, it is important to note that it should not replace conventional medical treatments for ear infections, especially in severe or persistent cases.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, particularly if you are taking other medications, as it can interact with certain drugs.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal capsules containing echinacea are typically standardized to ensure consistent potency and are available in various forms, including dried root or leaf extracts. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for children or individuals with allergies or chronic health conditions.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, the evidence for its effectiveness in treating ear infections remains inconclusive, and it should be used as a complementary therapy rather than a primary treatment.</p><h2 id="4">4. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/chamomilla-recutita-capsules.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making it a potential natural remedy for ear infections.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing chamomilla recutita are often used as a complementary therapy to support the body's healing process during ear infections, particularly in cases of mild to moderate symptoms. These capsules are typically made from standardized extracts of the flower heads, ensuring a consistent concentration of active compounds like flavonoids and essential oils. While they may help reduce inflammation and discomfort, they should not replace professional medical advice or prescribed treatments for more severe infections.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare provider before using chamomilla recutita capsules, especially in children or individuals with known allergies.</p><h2 id="5">5.

These capsules are typically made from standardized extracts of the plant, ensuring consistent potency and quality.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using salvia officinalis for ear infections, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Garlic (Allium sativum)</h2><img alt="allium sativum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/allium-sativum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential natural remedy for ear infections.</p><p>When encapsulated as herbal capsules, garlic can provide a convenient and standardized form of supplementation for individuals seeking alternative treatments.
