However, they should never be applied directly into the ear without proper dilution, as they can cause irritation or damage. Some people use a few drops of diluted essential oil in a warm compress or as part of a steam inhalation to alleviate symptoms.</p><p>While they may offer relief, they are not a substitute for medical treatment, and it is important to consult a healthcare professional for persistent or severe ear infections.</p>
