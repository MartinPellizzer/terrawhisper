These linctuses are typically made by extracting the plant's active compounds into a syrup-like form, which can be soothing when taken orally. However, it is important to note that echinacea linctuses are not a standard treatment for difficulty eating and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>The effectiveness and safety of echinacea in this context may vary, and it is often recommended to consult with a licensed herbalist or physician before use.</p><h2 id="7">7.
