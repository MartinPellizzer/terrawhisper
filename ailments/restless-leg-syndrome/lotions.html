Cannabis sativa</h2><img alt="cannabis sativa lotion" src="/images/preparations/cannabis-sativa-lotions.jpg"/><p>Cannabis sativa herbal lotions have gained attention as a potential natural remedy for restless leg syndrome (RLS), due to their calming and analgesic properties derived from cannabinoids like CBD.</p><p>These lotions are applied topically, allowing the active compounds to interact with skin receptors, potentially reducing the uncomfortable sensations and urges associated with RLS.
