Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/thymus-vulgaris-capsules.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris herbal capsules, derived from the plant commonly known as thyme, have been traditionally used for their potential immune-boosting properties.</p><p>These capsules are often marketed as a natural remedy to support the body's defense mechanisms, particularly in the context of respiratory infections like pertussis, or whooping cough. While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking thymus vulgaris to the treatment of pertussis, some studies suggest that its essential oils may possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. As a complementary therapy, thymus vulgaris capsules may help alleviate symptoms and support recovery in individuals with pertussis, though they should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these capsules, especially for vulnerable populations such as children or those with underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal capsules containing zingiber officinale are often marketed as natural remedies to support the immune system and reduce the severity of respiratory infections. However, it is important to note that ginger should not replace prescribed medical treatments for pertussis, and individuals should consult with healthcare professionals before using it as a complementary therapy.</p><p>Overall, while ginger may offer some supportive benefits, its efficacy in treating pertussis remains inconclusive and requires further research.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These capsules may help alleviate symptoms such as coughing and congestion by promoting mucus clearance and reducing inflammation in the airways. However, it is important to note that while eucalyptus globulus may offer some supportive benefits, it should not replace conventional medical treatments for pertussis, especially in severe cases.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies, particularly for infectious diseases like pertussis.</p><h2 id="4">4. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support immune function.</p><p>While it is frequently marketed for the prevention and treatment of colds and upper respiratory infections, its efficacy for pertussis, or whooping cough, remains inconclusive.

Black pepper (Piper nigrum)</h2><img alt="piper nigrum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/piper-nigrum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is widely recognized for its role in enhancing digestion and as a spice, its use in treating pertussis, or whooping cough, is less commonly discussed in modern medicine. Some preliminary studies suggest that the active compounds in black pepper, such as piperine, may have antimicrobial and immune-boosting effects that could support the body's response to respiratory infections. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support its use as a primary treatment for pertussis, and it should not replace conventional medical care.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal supplements, especially for conditions like pertussis, which can be serious and require prompt medical attention.</p><h2 id="9">9.
