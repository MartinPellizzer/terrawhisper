While they may provide some symptomatic relief, it is important to note that herbal creams are not a substitute for medical treatment, as pertussis is a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics for effective management. Due to limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy, they should be used as a complementary therapy under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Patients should always consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of pertussis.</p><div class="toc">
