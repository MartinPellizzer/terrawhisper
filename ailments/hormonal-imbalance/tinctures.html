As a complementary therapy, licorice tincture may support hormonal balance when used under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p><p>Its adaptogenic properties make it a valuable option for managing stress-induced hormonal fluctuations, though it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Herbal tinctures made from echinacea are typically prepared using alcohol as a solvent, allowing for the extraction of bioactive compounds such as alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, and polysaccharides. These compounds may help balance cortisol levels and reduce stress-related hormonal disruptions.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea tinctures, especially for individuals with pre-existing hormonal conditions or those on medication.</p><h2 id="7">7.
