Herbal capsules containing vitex are often used to alleviate symptoms like irregular periods, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and breast tenderness. Clinical studies suggest that vitex may help improve hormonal equilibrium, though individual results can vary.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before starting vitex, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The herb contains compounds like triterpene glycosides, which may interact with estrogen receptors, although it does not contain estrogen itself. While it is generally considered safe for short-term use, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any herbal supplement, especially for those with hormone-sensitive conditions.</p><p>As with any supplement, the quality and potency of Cimicifuga racemosa capsules can vary, so choosing a reputable brand is essential for effectiveness and safety.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential to support hormonal balance.</p><p>The active compounds in licorice root, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, may help regulate adrenal function and cortisol levels, which are closely linked to hormonal imbalances. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra are often used to address symptoms related to stress-induced hormonal fluctuations. However, due to its potential to increase blood pressure and affect electrolyte balance, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Overall, licorice root capsules may offer supportive benefits for hormonal health, but their use requires careful consideration of individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement commonly used in the form of capsules to support liver function and address hormonal imbalances.</p><p>It contains active compounds such as silymarin, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help regulate hormonal activity. These capsules are often recommended for individuals experiencing symptoms like irregular menstrual cycles, mood swings, or estrogen dominance. By supporting the liver’s detoxification processes, Silybum marianum may aid in the body's ability to balance hormone levels more effectively.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any herbal supplement, especially for those with existing health conditions or on medication.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Panax ginseng (Panax ginseng)</h2><img alt="panax ginseng capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/panax-ginseng-capsules.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng, a popular adaptogenic herb, is commonly used in herbal capsules to support hormonal balance by modulating the body's stress response and enhancing adrenal function.</p><p>It contains bioactive compounds such as ginsenosides, which may help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and influence the production of sex hormones. Studies suggest that Panax ginseng may help alleviate symptoms of hormonal imbalance, including fatigue, mood swings, and irregular menstrual cycles. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, as it may interact with certain medications or exacerbate conditions like hypertension.</p><p>When taken as part of a holistic approach, Panax ginseng herbal capsules may offer natural support for individuals seeking to restore hormonal equilibrium.</p><h2 id="8">8. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare)</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/foeniculum-vulgare-capsules.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance, particularly in women.</p><p>The essential oils in fennel seeds contain compounds like anethol and estragol, which may help regulate estrogen levels and alleviate symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and mood swings. Herbal capsules made from fennel are often used to address hormonal imbalances by supporting the endocrine system and promoting overall hormonal harmony.
