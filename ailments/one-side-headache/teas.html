Herbal teas made from vitex are often consumed as a natural remedy for women experiencing hormonal headaches, particularly during the menstrual cycle or perimenopause. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses may vary, and it should be used as part of a holistic approach to headache management.</p><h2 id="5">5.
