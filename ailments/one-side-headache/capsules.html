They work by reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches through mechanisms that may involve improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, or modulating neurotransmitter activity. However, their effectiveness can vary among individuals, and it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any herbal treatment.</p><p>While herbal capsules may provide relief for some, they should not replace medical advice or prescribed treatments for persistent or severe headaches.</p>
