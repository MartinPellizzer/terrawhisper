They are particularly effective for headaches caused by muscle tension or stress, making them a popular alternative to over-the-counter medications. Many people prefer herbal creams because they are generally gentle on the skin and may have fewer side effects compared to synthetic pain relievers.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially if the headache is persistent or severe.</p>
