Eucalyptus globulus</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus cream" src="/images/preparations/eucalyptus-globulus-creams.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus oil, is often incorporated into herbal creams to help alleviate chest congestion due to its expectorant and decongestant properties.</p><p>These creams typically combine eucalyptus oil with other natural ingredients like menthol, camphor, and lavender to enhance their therapeutic effects. When applied topically to the chest, the warming sensation of the cream can help loosen mucus and ease breathing, providing relief from symptoms of colds, bronchitis, or sinusitis.
