Leonurus cardiaca</h2><img alt="leonurus cardiaca syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/leonurus-cardiaca-syrups.jpg"/><p>Leonurus cardiaca, commonly known as Motherwort, has been traditionally used to support women during menopause due to its calming and hormonal balancing properties.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from Leonurus cardiaca are often formulated to help alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances associated with menopause.

The active compounds in licorice, including glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic properties that may help the body manage stress and hormonal fluctuations. However, long-term use of licorice syrups should be approached with caution due to potential side effects like increased blood pressure and fluid retention.</p><p>It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating licorice-based syrups into a menopause management regimen.</p><h2 id="6">6.

These syrups are typically made from the dried flowers and roots of the plant and are often combined with other herbs to enhance their therapeutic effects. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>Despite its popularity, scientific evidence supporting its specific benefits for menopause remains limited, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><h2 id="7">7. Paeonia suffruticosa</h2><img alt="paeonia suffruticosa syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/paeonia-suffruticosa-syrups.jpg"/><p>Paeonia suffruticosa, commonly known as tree peony, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential to support hormonal balance and alleviate menopausal symptoms.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from this plant are believed to help ease symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings by regulating estrogen levels.

Symphytum officinale</h2><img alt="symphytum officinale syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/symphytum-officinale-syrups.jpg"/><p>Symphytum officinale, commonly known as comfrey, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support overall health.</p><p>While it is most well-known for its healing properties on bones and muscles, some studies suggest it may also offer benefits for women experiencing menopause. However, it is important to note that comfrey contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic to the liver if consumed in large amounts or over a prolonged period. As a result, it is generally not recommended for long-term use, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.</p><p>Due to these safety concerns, many herbal practitioners advise caution and recommend consulting a healthcare professional before using comfrey-based syrups during menopause.</p><h2 id="9">9.

These syrups are often combined with other adaptogenic herbs like black cohosh or sage to enhance their effectiveness. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Equisetum arvense specifically for menopause is limited, and individuals should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, potential side effects and interactions with medications should be carefully considered.</p><h2 id="10">10.
