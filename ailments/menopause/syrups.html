These syrups may alleviate common menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and irregular menstrual cycles. While generally considered safe, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any herbal supplement, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>Vitex agnus-castus herbal syrups are typically taken orally, with dosage varying based on individual needs and product recommendations.</p><h2 id="2">2.
