Some studies suggest that mucillages may also help regulate blood sugar levels and support overall gut health, making them a valuable addition to a balanced diet. For menopausal women, incorporating mucillages into their daily routine may aid in managing symptoms such as bloating and irregular digestion.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before adding any new supplement to one's regimen, especially if experiencing other menopausal symptoms.</p><div class="toc">
