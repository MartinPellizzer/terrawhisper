These properties can help reduce inflammation and combat bacterial infections that often contribute to gum pain and periodontal disease. Sage juice can be used as a natural remedy by gently swishing it in the mouth or applying it directly to affected areas.</p><p>While it may offer relief, it is advisable to consult a dental professional for persistent or severe gum issues.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, work to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain and inflammation. To prepare the juice, fresh ginger root is typically grated and blended with water or a small amount of honey for better taste.</p><p>Regular consumption of ginger juice may support overall oral health and serve as a complementary therapy to conventional treatments for gum pain.</p><h2 id="4">4.

The active compounds in echinacea, such as alkamides and polysaccharides, may help reduce swelling and discomfort in the gums. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea for gum pain, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects for some individuals.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, echinacea should not replace professional dental care for persistent or severe gum issues.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Sanguinaria canadensis</h2><img alt="sanguinaria canadensis juice" src="/images/preparations/sanguinaria-canadensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Sanguinaria canadensis, commonly known as bloodroot, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is not typically recommended for direct application to the gums due to its potent and potentially irritating compounds, some herbal practitioners suggest using diluted extracts or juices in small quantities to alleviate gum pain. The active compounds, such as sanguinarine, may help reduce bacterial growth and soothe inflamed tissues, though caution is necessary to avoid irritation or toxicity. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using bloodroot for gum issues, as it can interact with medications and may have adverse effects if not prepared properly.</p><p>Overall, while bloodroot may offer some relief for gum pain, its use should be approached with careful consideration and under professional guidance.</p><h2 id="9">9.
