When applied directly to sore gums or used as a mouth rinse, sage tinctures can provide relief from irritation and promote healing. Many people find that regular use of sage-based tinctures helps prevent gum infections and supports overall oral health.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these tinctures, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
