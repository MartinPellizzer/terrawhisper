While herbal baths primarily target relaxation and overall comfort, they are not a direct treatment for dysphagia and should complement, rather than replace, medical advice and professional care. Some people find that the steam and warmth of the bath can help relax the muscles in the throat and improve respiratory function, which may indirectly support swallowing.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using herbal baths, especially if the individual has underlying health conditions or is taking medications.</p>
