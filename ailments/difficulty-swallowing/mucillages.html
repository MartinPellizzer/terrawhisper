They are often used in traditional medicine to soothe sore throats and ease the passage of pills or thick liquids. When mixed with water, they form a slippery coating that can coat the throat and reduce the sensation of dryness or roughness.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using herbal mucillages, especially for individuals with underlying medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><div class="toc">
