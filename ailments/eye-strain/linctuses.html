Eye strain is often caused by prolonged screen use, dryness, or fatigue, and it is best treated with artificial tears, proper lighting, and regular breaks. Using herbal linctuses on the eyes can be harmful, as they may cause irritation or allergic reactions.</p><p>For effective relief of eye strain, it is recommended to consult an eye care professional and use appropriate eye care products specifically formulated for the eyes.</p><div class="toc">

However, it is important to note that these products are not a substitute for conventional treatments like eye exercises, proper lighting, or breaks during screen time.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>CNICUS BENEDICTUS herbal linctuses are traditional remedies used to alleviate symptoms of eye strain, often associated with prolonged screen use or fatigue.</p><p>This herbal preparation is believed to support ocular health by promoting relaxation of the eye muscles and reducing irritation.

The anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties of lavender help relax the muscles around the eyes, providing relief from fatigue and tension caused by prolonged screen use or reading. Additionally, the aromatic compounds in lavender may help reduce mental fatigue and promote a sense of relaxation, complementing its physical soothing effects.</p><p>While not a substitute for professional medical advice, lavender-based linctuses offer a natural and gentle option for those seeking relief from mild eye strain.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support hormonal balance and overall wellness.</p><p>While it is often associated with menstrual health, some studies suggest it may also have beneficial effects on eye strain by promoting relaxation and reducing stress, which are common contributors to visual fatigue.
