When used as a tincture, ginkgo biloba is typically taken orally, and some users report reduced fatigue and improved focus after regular use. While it is generally considered safe, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, ginkgo biloba tinctures may offer a natural approach to supporting eye comfort and reducing the effects of prolonged screen time.</p><h2 id="2">2. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tincture" src="/images/preparations/tinctures/hypericum-perforatum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its calming and mood-enhancing properties.</p><p>While it is most well-known for its use in treating mild depression, some people also use hypericum perforatum tinctures to alleviate symptoms of eye strain, believing that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may help reduce fatigue and irritation in the eyes. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence directly supporting its effectiveness for eye strain, and its use should be approached with caution. Individuals considering hypericum perforatum tinctures for eye strain should consult with a healthcare professional, as it can interact with various medications and may cause side effects in some people.</p><p>Overall, while it may offer some potential benefits, it is not a substitute for proper rest, ergonomic adjustments, or medical treatment for persistent eye strain.</p><h2 id="3">3. Field horsetail (Equisetum arvense)</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tincture" src="/images/preparations/tinctures/equisetum-arvense-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, is a traditional herb that has been used for centuries in herbal medicine.</p><p>Its tinctures are often prepared using alcohol to extract the plant's bioactive compounds, including silica and flavonoids, which are believed to support eye health. These tinctures are sometimes recommended for alleviating symptoms of eye strain, such as dryness, fatigue, and blurred vision, due to their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While some herbalists suggest using horsetail tinctures as a complementary remedy for eye strain, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new herbal treatment.</p><p>Overall, equisetum arvense tinctures may offer natural support for eye health, but they should not replace conventional medical care for persistent or severe eye conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Although there is limited scientific research specifically linking Vitex agnus-castus tinctures to eye strain relief, its calming properties may indirectly support eye comfort by reducing stress-related tension. As a herbal tincture, it is typically taken orally and is believed to promote relaxation and balance within the body.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Vitex agnus-castus, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Chamomile is valued for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce redness, irritation, and fatigue associated with prolonged screen use or overuse of the eyes. When used as an eye drop or applied topically around the eyes, chamomile tinctures may offer soothing relief and promote relaxation of the ocular muscles.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using chamomile tinctures, especially for individuals with allergies or existing eye conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Herbal tinctures made from Silybum marianum are typically taken orally and may support overall eye health by promoting cellular repair and protecting against damage from free radicals. While research on its direct effects on eye strain is limited, some studies suggest that its supportive role in detoxification and tissue regeneration could indirectly benefit eye health.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium tincture" src="/images/preparations/tinctures/achillea-millefolium-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it may help alleviate symptoms of eye strain by reducing irritation and promoting relaxation of the eye muscles.
