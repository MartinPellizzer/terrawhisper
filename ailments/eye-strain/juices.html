<h2 id="1">1. Ginkgo biloba</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba juice" src="/images/preparations/ginkgo-biloba-juices.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal juices are often used to support eye health and alleviate symptoms of eye strain due to their rich content of antioxidants and flavonoids, which may improve blood circulation and reduce oxidative stress.</p><p>These juices are believed to enhance cognitive function and visual acuity, making them a popular choice for individuals who spend long hours working on computers or reading. While some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may help in reducing eye fatigue, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for specific eye conditions. When consumed as part of a balanced diet, ginkgo biloba juice may contribute to overall eye wellness, though it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating ginkgo biloba into your routine, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support hormonal balance and overall wellness.</p><p>While it is often associated with menstrual health, recent interest has grown around its potential benefits for eye strain, particularly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the eyes, which are common contributors to fatigue and discomfort from prolonged screen use. Some studies suggest that the compounds in vitex agnus-castus may support the health of the ocular tissues and improve circulation around the eyes.</p><p>As a result, herbal juices made from vitex agnus-castus are increasingly being explored as a natural complement to eye care routines, though more research is needed to confirm their efficacy for this specific use.</p><h2 id="3">3.

However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking hypericum perforatum juice to the alleviation of eye strain, and its safety and efficacy for this specific use remain unclear. When consumed as part of a juice, it may interact with certain medications, so caution is advised.</p><p>It is recommended to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating hypericum perforatum into a regimen for eye strain or any other health condition.</p><h2 id="4">4. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense juice" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-juices.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its high concentration of silica and other nutrients that may support eye health.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking equisetum arvense to the relief of eye strain, some herbal practitioners suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties could potentially help reduce eye fatigue and improve overall ocular function. Herbal juices made from equisetum arvense are often consumed in small doses to support the body's natural healing processes, though they should be used with caution due to their high silica content. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using equisetum arvense, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, the effectiveness of equisetum arvense for eye strain may vary and should be part of a broader approach to eye health and wellness.</p><h2 id="5">5. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn or St. Benedict's thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in alleviating eye strain.</p><p>This plant contains various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids and essential oils, which may support eye health by reducing inflammation and improving circulation. Herbal juices made from Cnicus benedictus are believed to nourish the eyes and relieve symptoms associated with prolonged screen use or visual fatigue. When consumed regularly, these juices may contribute to overall ocular wellness by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating this herb into one's regimen, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Herbal juices made from Silybum marianum can be consumed as part of a holistic approach to maintaining eye wellness, especially for individuals who spend long hours in front of screens. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking milk thistle juice to the relief of eye strain.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Lepidium meyenii</h2><img alt="lepidium meyenii juice" src="/images/preparations/lepidium-meyenii-juices.jpg"/><p>Lepidium meyenii, commonly known as Peruvian maca, is a root vegetable that has been traditionally used for its adaptogenic properties.</p><p>While it is not directly used as an herbal juice for eye strain, some formulations combine maca extract with other eye-supporting ingredients like bilberry, green tea, and ginkgo biloba to create herbal juices aimed at improving visual health. These juices are believed to enhance blood flow to the eyes and support the production of essential nutrients for eye function. The antioxidants in these blends may help reduce oxidative stress, which is often linked to eye fatigue and strain.</p><p>As a result, herbal juices containing Lepidium meyenii are increasingly popular as natural supplements for individuals experiencing prolonged screen time or visual discomfort.</p><h2 id="8">8. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis juice" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, commonly known as the tea plant, is the source of various herbal juices that are believed to support eye health and alleviate eye strain.</p><p>These juices, often derived from green or black tea, contain antioxidants like catechins and polyphenols that help reduce oxidative stress in the eyes. Regular consumption of Camellia sinensis-based herbal juices may improve blood flow to the eyes and support the health of the retina and optic nerve. Additionally, the caffeine in these juices can enhance alertness and reduce mental fatigue, indirectly easing symptoms of eye strain.</p><p>However, it is important to consume these juices in moderation to avoid excessive caffeine intake, which can have adverse effects on eye health.</p><h2 id="9">9. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita juice" src="/images/preparations/chamomilla-recutita-juices.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, has been traditionally used for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a popular choice for relieving eye strain.</p><p>When used in the form of herbal juices, chamomilla recutita can help soothe tired, irritated eyes by reducing inflammation and promoting relaxation of the ocular muscles. The active compounds in chamomile, such as bisabolol and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to ease discomfort associated with prolonged screen time or visual fatigue. To use chamomilla recutita juice for eye strain, it is typically diluted with water or applied as a compress to the closed eyelids.</p><p>While generally safe for topical use, individuals with allergies to plants in the daisy family should exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into their eye care routine.</p><h2 id="10">10.

The herb is believed to support the nervous system, potentially leading to better focus and reduced eye fatigue during prolonged screen time. Some formulations of Bacopa monnieri juice are combined with other herbs like gotu kola to enhance its effects on vision and relaxation.</p><p>While more research is needed, many users report improved concentration and reduced eye discomfort when incorporating Bacopa monnieri into their daily routine.</p>
