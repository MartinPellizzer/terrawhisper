Herbal creams infused with zingiber officinale are often applied topically to the throat area to provide soothing relief and promote healing. These creams may also help stimulate circulation, which can ease congestion and support the body's natural process of clearing mucus.</p><p>While they are not a substitute for medical treatment, ginger-based creams can be a complementary remedy for mild throat discomfort and excess mucus.</p><h2 id="2">2.
