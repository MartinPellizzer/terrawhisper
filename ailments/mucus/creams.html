While they may provide temporary relief by easing the sensation of mucus and promoting airflow, they are not a cure for underlying conditions such as bronchitis or allergies. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist, as herbal creams may not address the root cause of excessive mucus production.</p><p>Combining these creams with other remedies like steam inhalation or humidifiers can enhance their effectiveness in managing throat discomfort.</p><div class="toc">
