Parsley (Petroselinum crispum)</h2><img alt="petroselinum crispum lotion" src="/images/preparations/lotions/petroselinum-crispum-lotions.jpg"/><p>Petroselinum crispum, commonly known as parsley, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential soothing effects on the respiratory system.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal lotion, parsley may help alleviate mucus buildup in the throat by promoting expectoration and reducing inflammation.
