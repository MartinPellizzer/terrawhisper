Herbal juices made from vitex may help alleviate cramping by promoting uterine tone and reducing inflammation.

When consumed as a herbal juice, fennel can also help regulate hormonal imbalances that contribute to painful menstruation. It is typically prepared by infusing fennel seeds or leaves in water or juice, and it is often recommended to drink it in warm form for better absorption.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using fennel, especially during pregnancy or if taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has gained attention for its potential benefits in alleviating menstrual cramps.</p><p>The active compound, silymarin, is believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help reduce uterine inflammation and muscle spasms associated with menstruation. While some studies suggest that milk thistle may support overall reproductive health, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy specifically for menstrual pain. Herbal juices made from milk thistle are often consumed as part of a holistic approach to managing menstrual discomfort.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using these juices, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.

To prepare the juice, fresh chamomile flowers are typically blended with other mild herbs like lemon or ginger for added flavor and benefits.</p><p>Regular consumption of chamomile herbal juice may support overall menstrual health and promote relaxation during the menstrual cycle.</p>
