Varicose veins are typically managed through lifestyle changes, compression therapy, and medical interventions like sclerotherapy or laser treatment. Some individuals may mistakenly use herbal lozenges in hopes of improving circulation, but this is not supported by clinical evidence.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of varicose veins.</p>
