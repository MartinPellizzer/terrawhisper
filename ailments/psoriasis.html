<p>Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and scaly patches, resulting from an overactive immune system.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have gained popularity in treating psoriasis due to their potential to reduce inflammation, promote skin healing, and alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Herbs such as Aloe vera, Chamomile, and Calendula are often used to soothe and calm the skin, while Turmeric, Ginger, and Willow bark are valued for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like ointments, creams, and teas made from herbs like Echinacea, Licorice root, and Silymarin can help to reduce the severity of psoriasis symptoms and promote overall skin health.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes psoriasis?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of psoriasis are genetic mutations and an overactive immune system, which trigger inflammation and skin cell production.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of psoriasis include skin injuries, infections, and certain medications, which can trigger a flare-up by disrupting the skin's natural balance.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing psoriasis include a diet high in processed foods and sugar, as well as stress and lack of sleep, which can weaken the immune system and lead to inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, smoking and excessive sun exposure can also contribute to the development of psoriasis.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal psoriasis?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat psoriasis are rich in bioactive compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, helping to alleviate symptoms of redness, itching, and scaling.</p>
<p>Aloe vera, for instance, contains aloin and aloe-emodin, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and promote wound healing, while chamomile and calendula possess flavonoids and triterpenoids that soothe and calm irritated skin.</p>
<p>Turmeric contains curcumin, a polyphenol with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities that help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress associated with psoriasis.</p>
<p>Additionally, tea tree oil, rich in cineole and terpinen-4-ol, has antimicrobial properties that help control bacterial overgrowth and promote a healthy skin environment.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat psoriasis?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat psoriasis are often made into teas, infusions, and topical creams.</p>
<p>Drinking teas infused with soothing and anti-inflammatory properties can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with the condition, while topical creams made with emollient-rich ingredients can help to moisturize and soothe dry, itchy skin.</p>
<p>Infusions that promote skin health and reduce inflammation can be consumed to help alleviate symptoms of psoriasis, such as scaling and itching.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations are made into ointments or salves that can be applied directly to affected areas to provide targeted relief and reduce the appearance of psoriasis lesions.</p>
