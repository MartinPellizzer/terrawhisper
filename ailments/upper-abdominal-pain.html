Historical medical texts, such as those from the Greek physician Galen, also mention the use of herbs like fennel and anise for soothing the stomach and reducing pain.</p><p>Modern research continues to explore these historical uses, validating some of the efficacy of these herbs through clinical trials and pharmacological studies.</p>
