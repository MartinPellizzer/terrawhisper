Some studies suggest that certain herbal extracts may help enhance blood flow and alleviate symptoms like claudication, though more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy. While herbal tinctures are generally considered safe when used as directed, they can interact with prescription medications and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Overall, they may offer a natural alternative or adjunct to conventional treatments for PAOD, but their role remains supportive rather than primary.</p>
