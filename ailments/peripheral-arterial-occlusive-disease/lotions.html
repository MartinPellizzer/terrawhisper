While some studies suggest that certain herbal compounds may enhance blood flow and alleviate symptoms like leg pain, the scientific evidence supporting their efficacy is limited and varies. It is important for patients to consult with healthcare professionals before using herbal lotions, as they may interact with other medications or have adverse effects.</p><p>Overall, herbal lotions should be considered as adjuncts to standard medical treatments rather than replacements for proven therapies.</p>
