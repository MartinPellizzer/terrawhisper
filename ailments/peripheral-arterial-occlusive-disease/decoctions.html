<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"
src="/images/preparations/decoctions/ginkgo-biloba-herbal-decoctions.jpg"
alt="herbal decoctions with Ginkgo biloba">
<p>Ginkgo biloba decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a condition characterized by narrowed or blocked arteries in the legs.</p>
<p>The flavonoids and terpenoids present in Ginkgo biloba, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and bilobalide, are believed to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation, thereby alleviating symptoms of the ailment.</p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba decoctions are thought to help treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease by increasing nitric oxide production, which relaxes blood vessels and improves circulation, and by scavenging free radicals that can damage blood vessels.</p>
<p>The benefits of using Ginkgo biloba decoctions for this ailment include improved walking distance, reduced pain, and enhanced overall quality of life.</p>

<h2 id="1">2. Panax ginseng decoctions</h2>

<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"
src="/images/preparations/decoctions/panax-ginseng-herbal-decoctions.jpg"
alt="herbal decoctions with Panax ginseng">
<p>Panax ginseng decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a condition characterized by the narrowing of blood vessels in the limbs, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply.</p>
<p>The ginsenosides, a group of bioactive saponins present in Panax ginseng decoctions, exhibit vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which help to improve blood circulation and reduce inflammation in the affected areas.</p>
<p>By increasing nitric oxide production and reducing endothelin-1 levels, Panax ginseng decoctions can help to dilate blood vessels and improve microcirculation, thereby alleviating symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.</p>
<p>The benefits of using Panax ginseng decoctions to treat this condition include improved walking distance, reduced pain and fatigue, and enhanced overall quality of life.</p>

<h2 id="2">3. Curcuma longa decoctions</h2>

<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"

alt="herbal decoctions with Curcuma longa">
<p>Curcuma longa decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the limbs.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Curcuma longa, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, possess potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory properties, which help to improve blood flow and reduce oxidative stress in the affected areas.</p>
<p>These properties enable Curcuma longa decoctions to help treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease by reducing inflammation, improving endothelial function, and promoting the formation of new blood vessels.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of Curcuma longa decoctions may help alleviate symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, including pain, weakness, and decreased mobility, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.</p>

<h2 id="3">4. Zingiber officinale decoctions</h2>

<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"
src="/images/preparations/decoctions/zingiber-officinale-herbal-decoctions.jpg"
alt="herbal decoctions with Zingiber officinale">
<p>Zingiber officinale decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory properties.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Zingiber officinale, including gingerol and shogaol, help to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the affected arteries, thereby alleviating the symptoms of PAOD.</p>
<p>The decoctions of Zingiber officinale have been found to inhibit the formation of platelet aggregates and reduce the levels of inflammatory markers, thereby helping to treat PAOD.</p>
<p>The benefits of using Zingiber officinale decoctions for PAOD include improved blood flow, reduced pain and inflammation, and enhanced overall cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2 id="4">5. Angelica sinensis decoctions</h2>

<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"
src="/images/preparations/decoctions/angelica-sinensis-herbal-decoctions.jpg"
alt="herbal decoctions with Angelica sinensis">
<p>Angelica sinensis decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) due to their anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and vasodilatory properties.</p>
<p>These properties help to improve blood circulation, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and promote the regeneration of blood vessels, ultimately alleviating the symptoms of PAOD.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Angelica sinensis decoctions, including ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, and polysaccharides, are responsible for their therapeutic effects by inhibiting platelet aggregation, reducing blood viscosity, and promoting angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Regular use of Angelica sinensis decoctions has been shown to improve walking distance, reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication, and enhance overall quality of life in patients with PAOD.</p>

<h2 id="5">6. Astragalus membranaceus decoctions</h2>

<img style="margin-bottom: 16px;"
src="/images/preparations/decoctions/astragalus-membranaceus-herbal-decoctions.jpg"
alt="herbal decoctions with Astragalus membranaceus">
<p>Astragalus membranaceus decoctions have been traditionally used to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Astragalus membranaceus, including flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides, help to improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and prevent cell death in the affected tissues.</p>
<p>By increasing nitric oxide production and enhancing endothelial function, Astragalus membranaceus decoctions can help to alleviate symptoms of PAOD, such as intermittent claudication and pain in the legs.</p>
<p>The benefits of using Astragalus membranaceus decoctions to treat PAOD include improved exercise tolerance, reduced risk of cardiovascular events, and enhanced overall quality of life.</p>

<h2 id="6">7. Paeonia lactiflora decoctions</h2>
