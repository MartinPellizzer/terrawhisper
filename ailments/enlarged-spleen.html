<p>Enlarged spleen is a medical condition where the spleen, a vital organ responsible for filtering the blood and storing red blood cells, becomes enlarged due to various reasons such as infections, injuries, or diseases.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat this ailment, offering a natural and effective approach to alleviate symptoms and promote overall health.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like turmeric, ginger, and ashwagandha have anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce swelling and pain associated with an enlarged spleen.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as spleen tea made with herbs like dandelion root and burdock root can also be used to support liver and spleen function, while herbal supplements like milk thistle and licorice root can help detoxify the body and promote spleen health.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes enlarged spleen?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of enlarged spleen are infections, particularly those caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and liver diseases like cirrhosis, where the spleen becomes congested due to the liver's inability to filter blood efficiently.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include blood cancers like leukemia, which can cause the spleen to become overactive and enlarged, as well as genetic disorders like hereditary spherocytosis, which affect the production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>Lifestyle factors such as heavy alcohol consumption, which can lead to liver disease, and certain occupations that expose individuals to heavy metals or chemicals, can also increase the risk of developing an enlarged spleen.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain genetic conditions like Gaucher's disease, which can cause the accumulation of harmful substances in the spleen, can also contribute to its enlargement.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal enlarged spleen?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat enlarged spleen are turmeric and dandelion root, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to reduce swelling and promote detoxification.</p>
<p>Turmeric contains bioactive compounds such as curcumin, which has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes and cytokines that contribute to spleen enlargement.</p>
<p>Dandelion root, on the other hand, is rich in sesquiterpene lactones and triterpenoids, which have been found to enhance liver function and promote the elimination of toxins that may be causing the enlarged spleen.</p>
<p>By modulating the immune response and reducing oxidative stress, these herbs can help alleviate symptoms and promote spleen health.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat enlarged spleen?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat enlarged spleen are teas and infusions made with herbs that have anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties, such as decoctions and infusions used as hot or cold compresses, and herbal tinctures added to water or other liquids for consumption.</p>
<p>These preparations help to reduce swelling and promote the removal of excess fluids from the body, alleviating symptoms of the condition.</p>
<p>In addition, some herbal preparations are used externally as poultices or wraps to apply heat or cold to the affected area, promoting blood flow and reducing pain.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of herbal infusions and decoctions can also help to strengthen the immune system and reduce the risk of future spleen enlargement.</p>
