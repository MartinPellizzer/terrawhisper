Hypericum perforatum linctuses, or herbal preparations designed for throat or ear use, may help provide relief by acting as a natural antihistamine and reducing allergic reactions that contribute to ear itching. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such remedies, especially if the itching is caused by an infection or other underlying condition.</p><p>Overall, while hypericum perforatum may offer some symptomatic relief for itchy ears, it should be used as part of a broader treatment plan under medical guidance.</p><h2 id="2">2.
