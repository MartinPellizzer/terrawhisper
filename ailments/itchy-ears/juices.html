To make the juice, fresh or dried nettle leaves are typically blended with water or a mild juice extractor to preserve their nutrients. The juice can be applied topically to the affected area or consumed internally under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>While some people find relief from itchy ears using nettle juice, it is important to consult a doctor before using it, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="2">2.

However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence specifically supporting its use for ear-related conditions. When considering using St. John's Wort for itchy ears, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure safety and avoid potential interactions with other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, proper preparation and dosage are essential to minimize adverse effects.</p><h2 id="3">3.

However, there is limited scientific evidence specifically supporting the use of echinacea herbal juices for treating itchy ears. Some anecdotal reports suggest that it may help reduce irritation and inflammation in the ear canal, but more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is a herbal remedy often used to soothe itchy ears due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, calendula can be applied externally to the affected area to help reduce irritation and redness.

To use yarrow juice for itchy ears, it is typically diluted with water or another carrier liquid to avoid irritation, as undiluted juice can be too strong. Some herbalists recommend applying a few drops of the diluted yarrow juice to the affected area using a clean dropper or cotton swab.</p><p>While yarrow may offer relief for mild ear itchiness, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if symptoms persist or are accompanied by infection.</p><h2 id="6">6.

The high concentration of vitamin C and antioxidants in rose hip juice can help support the body's natural healing processes and strengthen the immune system.
