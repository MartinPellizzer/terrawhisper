<h2 id="0">What causes altitude sickness?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of altitude sickness are the decrease in air pressure and oxygen levels at high elevations, which can lead to the body's inability to adapt quickly enough to the lower oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include dehydration, overexertion, and sleeping altitude, where individuals may not fully acclimate to their new environment even when at rest.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing altitude sickness include smoking, as it reduces lung function and efficiency, and obesity, as it can lead to respiratory problems and decreased oxygen intake.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, are also more susceptible to altitude sickness due to their compromised lung function.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal altitude sickness?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat altitude sickness are those that help alleviate symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Examples of herbs that possess therapeutic actions to treat altitude sickness include Ginkgo biloba, which improves circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues, and Rhodiola rosea, which reduces stress and fatigue.</p>
<p>These herbs contain bioactive compounds like flavonoids and terpenoids in Ginkgo biloba and rosavin and salidroside in Rhodiola rosea, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help mitigate the effects of high altitude.</p>
<p>Additionally, the herb Sutherlandia frutescens, also known as "Hoodia," contains bioactive compounds like flavonoids and oligopeptides that help regulate breathing and reduce oxidative stress associated with altitude sickness.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat altitude sickness?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat altitude sickness are teas, infusions, and decoctions that help to reduce inflammation and promote oxygenation in the body.</p>
<p>These preparations may include a combination of warming and blood-stimulating herbs in the form of tea blends, as well as cooling and calming herbs in the form of infusions, to balance the body's response to high altitude.</p>
<p>Decoctions of herbs rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds may also be used to help alleviate symptoms such as headaches and fatigue.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations may be formulated to help increase red blood cell count and improve circulation, thereby reducing the risk of altitude sickness.</p>
