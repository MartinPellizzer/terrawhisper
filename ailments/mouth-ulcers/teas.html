The active compounds in the herb, such as hypericin and hyperforin, are believed to contribute to its healing effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it, as it may interact with certain medications and is not a substitute for medical treatment.</p><h2 id="2">2.

It is often combined with other herbs like licorice root or chamomile to enhance its therapeutic benefits.</p><p>While generally safe for most people, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using aloe-based teas, especially for those with existing medical conditions or allergies.</p><h2 id="6">6. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/glycyrrhiza-glabra-teas.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties, making it a popular choice for treating mouth ulcers.</p><p>The active compounds in licorice root, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects that help reduce pain and swelling in ulcers. When brewed into a herbal tea, licorice root can provide a calming effect on the mouth's mucous membranes, promoting healing and comfort.

Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, contains bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and antioxidants that may help in reducing inflammation and promoting healing.</p><p>These properties make Camellia sinensis herbal teas a potential natural remedy for mouth ulcers, as they can soothe irritated tissues and reduce bacterial growth.
