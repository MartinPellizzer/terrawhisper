Herbal capsules containing echinacea are generally considered safe for most adults when used as directed, though they may cause mild side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort. Due to limited scientific evidence on its use for chickenpox, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea as a treatment for this viral infection.</p><p>Overall, while echinacea may offer some immune support, it should not replace conventional medical care for chickenpox.</p><h2 id="2">2.
