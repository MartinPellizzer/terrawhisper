These decoctions are typically prepared by simmering the dried herbs in water for several minutes to extract their active compounds.

Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis decoction" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and healing properties.</p><p>While it is widely recognized for its benefits in human skin care and wound healing, its use in treating chickenpox in humans is not extensively supported by clinical studies. Some anecdotal reports suggest that aloe vera gel may help reduce the severity of chickenpox symptoms by alleviating itching and promoting skin healing. However, there is limited scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of aloe barbadensis herbal decoctions specifically for chickenpox in humans.</p><p>As a result, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, including aloe barbadensis, for chickenpox treatment.</p><h2 id="7">7.

While there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking Rosa canina to chickenpox treatment, its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties have led to its use in supportive care during viral infections. It is often prepared by steeping dried rosehips in hot water to create a tea, which can be consumed internally or applied topically.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for children or individuals with underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
