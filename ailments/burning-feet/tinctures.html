Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum tincture" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is often used in herbal tinctures for its warming and circulatory stimulating properties.</p><p>These tinctures are believed to help alleviate the discomfort of burning feet by improving blood flow and reducing inflammation.
