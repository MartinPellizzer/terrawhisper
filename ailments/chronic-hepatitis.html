<p>Chronic hepatitis is a long-term inflammation of the liver caused by viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C, or non-infectious factors like autoimmune disease and exposure to toxins.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to treat chronic hepatitis due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties.</p>
<p>Certain herbs like milk thistle, dandelion root, and turmeric have been found to be effective in reducing liver inflammation and promoting liver regeneration.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as teas, tinctures, and capsules made from herbs like licorice root, ginger, and ginseng can also help alleviate symptoms and support liver health, while also providing additional benefits like reducing stress and improving digestion.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes chronic hepatitis?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of chronic hepatitis are viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C, which are transmitted through bodily fluids and cause liver inflammation.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include autoimmune hepatitis, where the body's immune system attacks liver cells, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a condition characterized by liver inflammation due to fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing chronic hepatitis include sharing needles or having unprotected sex, which can lead to viral transmission, and a diet high in saturated fats and sugars, which can contribute to NASH.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol or have underlying liver conditions, such as liver cirrhosis, are also at higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal chronic hepatitis?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat chronic hepatitis are turmeric, milk thistle, and dandelion root, which have demonstrated therapeutic actions such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help reduce liver inflammation and damage.</p>
<p>Turmeric's active compound, curcumin, exhibits anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties, while milk thistle's silymarin has hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects that help repair liver cells.</p>
<p>Dandelion root, rich in inulin and sesquiterpenes, has been shown to improve liver function and reduce oxidative stress, thereby alleviating symptoms of chronic hepatitis.</p>
<p>By harnessing the bioactive compounds and therapeutic actions of these herbs, individuals can potentially alleviate the symptoms and progression of chronic hepatitis.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat chronic hepatitis?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat chronic hepatitis are typically made from plants known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, such as decoctions, infusions, and tinctures that stimulate liver regeneration and reduce liver damage.</p>
<p>Some of these preparations are also used to improve liver function and reduce oxidative stress, while others help to enhance the body's natural detoxification processes.</p>
<p>Herbal infusions that promote liver health and reduce inflammation are often consumed as teas, and some of these preparations are also applied topically as poultices or compresses to target specific liver areas.</p>
<p>By combining various herbal preparations, individuals with chronic hepatitis may be able to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, and promote overall liver well-being.</p>
