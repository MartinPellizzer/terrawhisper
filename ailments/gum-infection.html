alt="herbal remedies for gum infection">
<p>Gum infection, also known as periodontitis, is a bacterial infection that affects the gums and bone supporting the teeth, leading to inflammation, pain, and potential tooth loss if left untreated.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat gum infections due to their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which help to reduce inflammation, prevent further infection, and promote healing.</p>
<p>Examples of herbs used to treat gum infections include Aloe vera, which soothes and calms the gums, Echinacea, which boosts the immune system to fight off infection, and Tea tree oil, which has antibacterial properties to combat the bacteria causing the infection.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as mouthwashes made with Sage, Chamomile, and Turmeric have also been effective in treating gum infections due to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, while herbal teas like Green tea and Ginger have been used to reduce inflammation and promote healing.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes gum infection?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of gum infection are poor oral hygiene and bacterial buildup, as a result of not brushing and flossing regularly, allowing plaque to accumulate and cause inflammation.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include smoking and tobacco use, as well as certain medical conditions such as diabetes and HIV/AIDS, which can impair the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight off infections.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing gum infection include a diet high in sugar and acidic foods, which can lead to tooth decay and create an environment conducive to bacterial growth, as well as poor nutrition and inadequate dental care.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who are under a lot of stress may be more prone to gum infection due to the negative impact of stress on the immune system.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal gum infection?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat gum infection are often rich in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory compounds that help to combat the underlying causes of the infection.</p>
<p>Examples include goldenseal, which has been shown to exhibit berberine, a compound with antibacterial properties that can help to reduce the severity of gum infection.</p>
<p>Another example is sage, which contains ursolic acid, a triterpenoid that has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce swelling and pain associated with gum infection.</p>
<p>Additionally, the use of licorice root, which contains glycyrrhizin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties that can help to soothe and protect the mucous membranes affected by gum infection.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat gum infection?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat gum infection are often in the form of teas, infusions, and mouthwashes, which can help to reduce inflammation and fight off bacteria.</p>
<p>Some of these preparations include a warm drink made with a specific root, which has been shown to have antibacterial properties, and a mouthwash made with a type of leaf, which has anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
<p>A decoction of a particular flower has also been traditionally used to treat gum infections, as it contains compounds that can help to reduce swelling and promote healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, a cold infusion of a certain bark has been used to help soothe and calm inflamed gums.</p>
