To prepare an herbal rinse, steep a handful of dried herbs in boiling water for about 15 minutes, then allow the liquid to cool to a comfortable temperature before use. Gargling with this infusion for 30 seconds to a minute several times a day can help reduce fungal growth and alleviate discomfort.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using herbal remedies, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p>

The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of nettle may contribute to creating an environment less favorable for Candida overgrowth. Herbal baths with urtica dioica can be a complementary therapy when used alongside conventional treatments for oral thrush.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using herbal remedies, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or allergies.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Melissa officinalis</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/melissa-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its calming and antifungal properties.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, lemon balm can help soothe irritation and reduce inflammation associated with oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans.

Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense bath" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-baths.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal baths for its high silica content and antimicrobial properties, which may help in treating oral thrush.</p><p>When used in a warm bath, the silica from horsetail can support the regeneration of tissues and promote healing in the mouth. The anti-fungal and astringent qualities of Equisetum arvense may help reduce the symptoms of oral thrush by inhibiting the growth of Candida albicans. However, it is important to note that while some people use horsetail baths as a complementary therapy, they should not replace conventional medical treatments for oral thrush.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedies, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.

However, it is important to note that thyme baths are not a direct treatment for oral thrush and should be used in conjunction with other medical treatments as recommended by a healthcare provider. The soothing properties of thyme may also help alleviate discomfort associated with oral thrush.</p><p>Due to its potent nature, thyme should always be properly diluted to avoid skin irritation or allergic reactions.</p><h2 id="10">10.
