When diluted properly with a carrier oil or water, they can be applied directly to the affected areas in the mouth, providing localized relief and supporting the body's natural defenses. However, it is important to use these oils cautiously, as they can be irritating if not properly diluted.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or underlying health conditions.</p><div class="toc">
