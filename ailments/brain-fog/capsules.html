<h2 id="1">1. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba)</h2><img alt="ginkgo biloba capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/ginkgo-biloba-capsules.jpg"/><p>Ginkgo biloba herbal capsules are commonly used to support cognitive function and alleviate symptoms of brain fog, which can result from stress, aging, or poor circulation.</p><p>The herb contains bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and terpenoids that are believed to enhance blood flow to the brain and protect neurons from oxidative stress. Studies suggest that ginkgo biloba may improve memory, concentration, and mental clarity by promoting better oxygenation of brain tissues. However, while some research supports its potential benefits, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to fully confirm its efficacy for brain fog.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting ginkgo biloba, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Panax ginseng (Panax ginseng)</h2><img alt="panax ginseng capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/panax-ginseng-capsules.jpg"/><p>Panax ginseng, a traditional herbal remedy, is commonly used in the form of capsules to support cognitive function and alleviate brain fog.</p><p>This adaptogenic herb is believed to enhance mental clarity, focus, and energy by influencing neurotransmitter activity and reducing oxidative stress in the brain. Studies suggest that Panax ginseng may improve memory and concentration, making it a popular choice for individuals experiencing mental fatigue or clouded thinking. The capsules offer a convenient and standardized way to consume the herb, ensuring consistent dosing and potency.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, especially for those with existing medical conditions or on medication.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compounds in Rhodiola rosea, such as rosavins and salidrosides, are believed to support neurotransmitter balance and improve oxygen utilization in the brain, which may help clear mental cloudiness. Studies suggest that Rhodiola rosea can reduce stress and fatigue, making it a natural remedy for individuals experiencing brain fog due to overwork or chronic stress.</p><p>When taken as part of a balanced lifestyle, these capsules may offer a gentle and effective way to enhance mental clarity and overall well-being.</p><h2 id="4">4. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains a powerful compound called curcumin, which has been studied for its potential cognitive benefits.</p><p>Herbal capsules made from Curcuma longa are often taken to support brain health and alleviate symptoms of brain fog, which can include mental fatigue, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Curcumin is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help reduce oxidative stress in the brain, potentially improving cognitive function. However, curcumin has low bioavailability, so many supplements include black pepper extract (piperine) to enhance absorption.</p><p>While some research suggests that turmeric may support cognitive health, more clinical studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness for brain fog in humans.</p><h2 id="5">5. Bacopa (Bacopa monnieri)</h2><img alt="bacopa monnieri capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/bacopa-monnieri-capsules.jpg"/><p>Bacopa monnieri, also known as Brahmi, is a traditional Ayurvedic herb that has been used for centuries to enhance cognitive function and reduce brain fog.</p><p>The active compounds in bacopa monnieri, such as bacosides, are believed to support nerve cell communication and improve memory retention. Clinical studies suggest that regular use of bacopa monnieri herbal capsules may help alleviate symptoms of mental fatigue and mental cloudiness. These capsules are often formulated with other nootropic herbs to enhance their cognitive benefits.</p><p>As a natural supplement, bacopa monnieri is generally considered safe, though it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.</p><h2 id="6">6. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its cognitive-enhancing properties, and modern research suggests that sage herbal capsules may help alleviate brain fog by supporting mental clarity and focus.</p><p>The active compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, are believed to influence neurotransmitter activity and reduce oxidative stress in the brain.

Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may help alleviate symptoms of brain fog.</p><p>This herb is believed to influence the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, potentially regulating the production of hormones like prolactin and luteinizing hormone, which can impact cognitive function. Herbal capsules containing vitex agnus-castus are often used by women experiencing hormonal fluctuations, such as during menstruation, menopause, or pregnancy, which can contribute to mental cloudiness. While research on its direct effects on brain fog is limited, some studies suggest that it may improve mood and cognitive clarity in individuals with hormonal imbalances.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with pre-existing conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)</h2><img alt="withania somnifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/withania-somnifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to support mental clarity and reduce stress.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing Withania somnifera are increasingly popular for their potential to alleviate brain fog, a condition characterized by mental fatigue, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. The active compounds in ashwagandha, such as withanolides, may help regulate cortisol levels and enhance cognitive function by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Studies suggest that regular use of ashwagandha supplements can improve memory, focus, and overall mental performance in individuals experiencing brain fog.</p><p>As a natural alternative to conventional nootropics, ashwagandha herbal capsules offer a holistic approach to supporting brain health and cognitive clarity.</p><h2 id="9">9.
