The anti-inflammatory properties of these mucillages may help reduce systemic inflammation, a contributing factor to cognitive impairment and brain fog. Additionally, some mucillages are believed to support the production of neurotransmitters and improve blood flow to the brain, enhancing mental clarity.</p><p>While more research is needed, preliminary studies and traditional use suggest that herbal mucillages may be a natural and supportive option for managing brain fog.</p><div class="toc">
