The active compounds in ginkgo biloba, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, potentially protecting brain cells from damage. While some studies suggest that ginkgo may offer mild cognitive benefits, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for brain fog specifically.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
