alt="herbal teas with Curcuma longa">
<p>Curcuma longa teas, an herbal preparation derived from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, have been traditionally used to treat white patches in mouth ailments, also known as oral leukoplakia.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Curcuma longa teas, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, exhibit potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties that help to treat this ailment.</p>
<p>These properties help to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit the proliferation of abnormal cells, and modulate the immune response, ultimately leading to the resolution of white patches in the mouth.</p>
<p>The benefits of using Curcuma longa teas to treat oral leukoplakia include its non-invasive nature, minimal side effects, and potential to prevent the progression of the disease to more severe conditions.</p>
