They may help reduce swelling and irritation in the prostate gland by forming a protective layer over the urinary tract. Some studies suggest that mucillages can improve urinary flow and reduce discomfort associated with chronic prostatitis.</p><p>While they are generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using them as a complementary therapy for prostatitis.</p><div class="toc">
