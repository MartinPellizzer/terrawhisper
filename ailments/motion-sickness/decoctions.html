Ocimum sanctum</h2><img alt="ocimum sanctum decoction" src="/images/preparations/ocimum-sanctum-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Ocimum sanctum, also known as holy basil, has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its calming and digestive properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from Ocimum sanctum leaves are believed to help alleviate symptoms of motion sickness by reducing nausea and promoting a sense of well-being. The plant contains essential oils and antioxidants that may support the body's ability to manage motion-induced discomfort.
