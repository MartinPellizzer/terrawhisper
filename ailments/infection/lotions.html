These lotions are sometimes applied topically to treat minor infections, such as skin abrasions or fungal infections, due to their natural antiseptic qualities. However, it is important to note that bloodroot is toxic if ingested and may cause skin irritation, so caution is necessary when using it externally.</p><p>While some studies suggest its efficacy in reducing microbial growth, further research is needed to fully understand its safety and effectiveness for treating infections.</p><h2 id="6">6.

When used as part of a holistic treatment plan, rosemary herbal lotions can help soothe irritated skin and promote faster recovery from infections.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these lotions, especially for severe or persistent infections.</p><h2 id="7">7. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita lotion" src="/images/preparations/lotions/chamomilla-recutita-lotions.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is often used in herbal lotions for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>These lotions can help soothe skin irritation and reduce redness, making them beneficial for minor infections such as eczema or fungal infections.

When applied topically, chamomile lotions may provide relief from symptoms associated with skin infections without the need for harsh chemicals.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using chamomile products, especially for severe or persistent infections.</p><h2 id="8">8. White cedar (Thuja occidentalis)</h2><img alt="thuja occidentalis lotion" src="/images/preparations/lotions/thuja-occidentalis-lotions.jpg"/><p>Thuja occidentalis, also known as arborvitae, is a traditional herbal plant that has been used for centuries in natural medicine.</p><p>Herbal lotions made from thuja occidentalis are often utilized for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties, which may help in combating certain types of infections. These lotions are typically prepared by infusing the dried leaves and stems of the plant into a carrier oil or water-based solution. While some studies suggest potential benefits, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using thuja-based products, as they may interact with medications or cause skin irritation.</p><p>Overall, thuja occidentalis herbal lotions are considered a complementary therapy rather than a primary treatment for infections.</p><h2 id="9">9.
