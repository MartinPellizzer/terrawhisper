Herbal juices made from fresh turmeric root can be consumed daily to support respiratory health and boost the immune system. To prepare the juice, fresh turmeric root is typically blended with water, lemon juice, and sometimes black pepper to enhance absorption.</p><p>While turmeric may offer relief for some individuals, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment for chronic or severe sinusitis.</p><h2 id="10">10.
