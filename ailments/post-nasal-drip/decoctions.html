Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica decoction" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic properties.</p><p>A decoction made from the leaves and stems of Urtica dioica can help alleviate symptoms of post-nasal drip by reducing mucus production and soothing irritated nasal passages.

Thymus vulgaris</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris decoction" src="/images/preparations/thymus-vulgaris-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from thyme can help alleviate symptoms of post nasal drip by reducing mucus production and soothing irritated nasal passages.
