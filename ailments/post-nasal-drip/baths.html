When added to warm water, these herbs release aromatic compounds that can help open up airways and ease nasal congestion when inhaled during the bath. The steam from the bath also helps to moisturize the nasal passages, reducing irritation and mucus buildup.</p><p>While herbal baths are generally safe, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before using them, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant.</p><div class="toc">
