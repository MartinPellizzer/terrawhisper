Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, herbal supplements are generally considered safer with fewer side effects, though they may not provide immediate relief. They are typically taken as part of a holistic approach that includes rest, stretching, and proper footwear.</p><p>While they can be effective for some individuals, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.</p>

While some studies suggest that silica may help in maintaining the integrity of ligaments and tendons, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy for this specific condition. These capsules are typically taken as a dietary supplement, and users are advised to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new herbal regimen.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, it is important to note that Equisetum arvense may have side effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort, and should not replace conventional medical treatments for plantar fasciitis.</p><h2 id="6">6.

When used in the form of capsules, hypericum perforatum is often taken orally, with the active compounds being absorbed into the bloodstream to target areas of inflammation in the foot. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using this herb, as it can interact with certain medications and may have side effects.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating plantar fasciitis specifically.</p><h2 id="7">7.

While it is generally considered safe, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a complementary therapy for plantar fasciitis.</p><p>Combining nigella sativa with other treatments like stretching, orthotics, and physical therapy may offer a more comprehensive approach to managing the condition.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitis vinifera</h2><img alt="vitis vinifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/vitis-vinifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitis vinifera herbal capsules, derived from the grapevine plant, are traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may offer potential benefits for managing plantar fasciitis.</p><p>These capsules contain resveratrol, a compound known to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair, which could help alleviate the pain and swelling associated with this condition.
