To prepare a decoction, these herbs are typically simmered in water for an extended period to extract their active compounds, creating a potent herbal tea or broth. Some individuals use these decoctions as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments like stretching exercises and orthotics.</p><p>While herbal decoctions may offer relief, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating them into a treatment regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><div class="toc">
