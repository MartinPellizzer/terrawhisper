To prepare a decoction, these herbs are typically simmered in water for an extended period to extract their active compounds, creating a potent herbal tea or broth. Some individuals use these decoctions as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments like stretching exercises and orthotics.</p><p>While herbal decoctions may offer relief, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating them into a treatment regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p>

St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum decoction" src="/images/preparations/decoctions/hypericum-perforatum-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for treating mild depression, some studies suggest it may also be beneficial for conditions involving inflammation, such as plantar fasciitis. Herbal decoctions made from Hypericum perforatum can be prepared by steeping the dried plant material in hot water, allowing the active compounds to be extracted. These decoctions may help reduce pain and inflammation in the plantar fascia by modulating inflammatory pathways in the body.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with various medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><h2 id="9">9.
