While scientific evidence on their direct impact on fever is limited, some studies suggest that echinacea may enhance immune function, which could indirectly help manage symptoms associated with fever. The mucillages may also contribute to hydration and comfort in the throat, which is often affected during illness.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While the primary therapeutic effects of St. John's wort are attributed to its hypericin and hyperforin content, the mucillages may play a supportive role in enhancing the herb's overall comfort and healing properties. The presence of mucillages can also aid in hydration and may help soothe symptoms associated with internal heat or inflammation.</p><p>However, it is important to note that mucillages alone are not the main active component responsible for the herb's traditional use in treating feverish conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4.
