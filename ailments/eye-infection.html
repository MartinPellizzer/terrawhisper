<p>Eye infection is an inflammatory condition affecting the eyes, usually caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and characterized by symptoms such as redness, discharge, and vision impairment.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to treat eye infections due to their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Herbs such as calendula, aloe vera, and chamomile are commonly used to treat eye infections, as they have soothing and calming effects that help reduce inflammation and promote healing.</p>
<p>Preparations like eye drops, ointments, and infusions made from herbs like goldenseal, echinacea, and tea tree oil have been effective in treating eye infections due to their ability to combat infection-causing pathogens and promote tissue repair.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes eye infection?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of eye infection are bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens that enter the eye through various means, such as contaminated water, contact lenses, or direct contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of eye infection can include weakened immune systems due to conditions like diabetes or HIV, as well as improper use of contact lenses or sharing makeup and makeup brushes, which can transfer bacteria and other pathogens to the eyes.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing an eye infection include working in environments with poor hygiene, such as in healthcare settings, or engaging in activities that involve direct contact with water, like swimming or diving, which can introduce pathogens to the eyes.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who wear contact lenses for extended periods or share them with others are also at a higher risk of developing an eye infection.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal eye infection?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat eye infection are Aloe vera, Calendula, and Echinacea, which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help soothe and protect the affected area.</p>
<p>Aloe vera's therapeutic action includes reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing, while Calendula's bioactive compounds, such as triterpenoids and flavonoids, exhibit antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
<p>Echinacea's therapeutic action involves stimulating the immune system to fight off infections, and its bioactive compounds, including alkylamides and caffeic acid derivatives, have anti-inflammatory properties that reduce eye inflammation.</p>
<p>These herbs work together to reduce eye redness, swelling, and discharge associated with eye infections.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat eye infection?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat eye infection are often made into soothing teas or infusions that are applied directly to the affected area or used as eye washes.</p>
<p>Some preparations are made into compresses or poultices to reduce swelling and promote healing.</p>
<p>Others are used as eye drops or ointments to combat infection and alleviate symptoms such as redness and discharge.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations are used as tonics or syrups to boost the body's immune system and support the recovery process.</p>
