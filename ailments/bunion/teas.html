However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using this herb, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>As with any complementary therapy, Sutherlandia frutescens should be used as part of a holistic approach to managing bunion symptoms, rather than a standalone treatment.</p><h2 id="7">7.
