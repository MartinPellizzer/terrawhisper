<p>Oral thrush is a fungal infection characterized by the growth of yeast cells in the mouth, leading to white patches on the tongue, gums, and inner cheeks.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective way to treat oral thrush, providing numerous benefits such as reduced inflammation, improved immune function, and gentle antifungal properties.</p>
<p>Herbs like Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia), Echinacea (Echinacea spp.</p>
<p>), and Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis) have been found to combat oral thrush due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like herbal teas (such as Peppermint, Chamomile, and Licorice root tea), tinctures (like Oil of Oregano and Garlic oil), and topical creams (like Calendula and Manuka honey) can be used to treat oral thrush, providing a gentle and soothing relief from symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes oral thrush?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of oral thrush are a weakened immune system, particularly in individuals with conditions such as HIV/AIDS, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can disrupt the natural balance of oral flora.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of oral thrush may include the use of inhaled corticosteroids, which can suppress the immune system and create an environment conducive to fungal growth, as well as dentures that are not properly fitted or cleaned.</p>
<p>People who are more likely to develop oral thrush include those with poor oral hygiene, a diet high in sugar, and a lifestyle that involves frequent consumption of antibiotics, as well as individuals who are malnourished or have a history of smoking.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, may also be at increased risk due to their compromised immune systems.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal oral thrush?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat oral thrush are Myrrh, Garlic, and Echinacea, which have demonstrated anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Myrrh's terpenoids, such as alpha-humulene and beta-bisabolol, exhibit antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions, while Garlic's allicin displays potent antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of Candida albicans.</p>
<p>Echinacea's flavonoids, including echinacoside and isobutylamides, stimulate the immune system and enhance the body's natural defense against fungal infections.</p>
<p>The combination of these herbs' bioactive compounds can help restore a healthy oral environment and reduce the severity of oral thrush symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat oral thrush?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat oral thrush are decoctions that are rich in antifungal and antibacterial properties, such as mouthwashes made from a combination of plants that are traditionally used to reduce inflammation and soothe mucous membranes.</p>
<p>Infusions of certain plants are also used to help alleviate symptoms of oral thrush, including teas that are high in antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations, like tinctures and glycerites, are applied topically to the affected area to help reduce the growth of Candida and other pathogens.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain herbal preparations, like syrups and lozenges, are used to help soothe and protect the mucous membranes in the mouth.</p>
