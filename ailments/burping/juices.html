When consumed as part of a herbal juice, black pepper can help break down food more efficiently, reducing the likelihood of excess gas and burping. However, it is important to use black pepper in moderation, as excessive consumption may irritate the stomach or worsen acid reflux.</p><p>Overall, incorporating piper nigrum into herbal juices may offer natural support for digestive health and reduce burping when used appropriately.</p><h2 id="7">7.
