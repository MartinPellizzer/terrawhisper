Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/silybum-marianum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy often used in the form of syrup to support digestive health.</p><p>While it is primarily recognized for its liver-protecting properties, some people use silybum marianum syrup to help alleviate symptoms like burping by improving overall digestion and reducing gas buildup.
