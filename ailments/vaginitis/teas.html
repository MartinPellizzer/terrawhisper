<h2 id="1">1. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild depression, it has also been explored for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be beneficial in managing symptoms of vaginitis. Some studies suggest that the active compounds in St. John's wort, such as hypericin and hyperforin, could help combat certain types of infections that contribute to vaginal inflammation. However, it is important to note that there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for vaginitis specifically, and it should not replace conventional medical treatments.</p><p>Individuals considering using St. John's wort for vaginitis should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure it is safe and appropriate for their condition.</p><h2 id="2">2. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal tea, it may offer potential relief for symptoms of vaginitis by reducing inflammation and balancing vaginal pH. The tea is typically made by steeping fresh or dried leaves in hot water, and it is often consumed internally or used in sitz baths. However, while some anecdotal evidence supports its use, scientific research on its effectiveness for vaginitis is limited.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using stinging nettle tea, especially if experiencing persistent or severe symptoms.</p><h2 id="3">3.

When brewed and applied topically or used as a sitz bath, chamomile tea can provide a gentle and natural approach to reducing inflammation and promoting healing. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using chamomile tea, especially if symptoms persist or worsen, as it may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating vaginitis.</p><h2 id="4">4.

The tea is typically made by steeping dried horsetail in hot water for several minutes, and it is often consumed as a mild tonic. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using horsetail tea, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>While some studies suggest its potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating vaginitis.</p><h2 id="5">5. Marigold (Calendula officinalis)</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/calendula-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is a herbal remedy often used in the form of tea to support vaginal health and alleviate symptoms of vaginitis.</p><p>This plant contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may help reduce irritation, redness, and infection associated with vaginal infections. When brewed into a soothing tea, calendula can be applied externally as a sitz bath or used in diluted form for vaginal irrigation to promote healing and comfort. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using calendula for vaginitis, especially if there is an underlying infection or if the individual is pregnant or nursing.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for this specific use.</p><h2 id="6">6. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>When used in the form of herbal tea, rosa canina may help alleviate symptoms of vaginitis by reducing inflammation and promoting a healthier vaginal environment.

While it is not a substitute for medical treatment, some studies suggest that its high vitamin C content may aid in healing and preventing recurrent infections.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using rosa canina tea, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/salvia-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal teas to support women's health, including the management of vaginitis.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of sage may help reduce symptoms such as itching, burning, and abnormal discharge associated with vaginal infections. When brewed as a tea, sage can be used as a soothing wash or internal remedy, though it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially during pregnancy or with existing medical conditions. While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating vaginitis.</p><p>Overall, sage herbal tea may be a complementary approach to conventional treatments, but it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><h2 id="8">8. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/achillea-millefolium-teas.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is not a primary treatment for vaginitis, some herbalists suggest using yarrow tea as a supportive remedy to help alleviate symptoms such as inflammation and discomfort. The tea may help balance vaginal flora by promoting a healthier environment, though it should not replace medical treatment for infections. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using yarrow, as it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>When preparing the tea, it is typically steeped in hot water and consumed in moderation to avoid potential side effects.</p><h2 id="9">9. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/matricaria-chamomilla-teas.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a popular herbal tea often used for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When consumed as a tea, chamomile may help alleviate symptoms of vaginitis by reducing inflammation and promoting a balanced vaginal environment. Its natural antiseptic and antimicrobial effects can help combat infections that may contribute to vaginitis.
