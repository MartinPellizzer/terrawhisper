While some herbal ingredients may help alleviate symptoms such as itching and irritation, their effectiveness can vary, and they may not address the underlying cause of the infection. It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using herbal creams, as improper use could lead to further irritation or mask a more serious condition.</p><p>Overall, herbal creams can be a soothing option for some individuals, but they should not replace professional medical advice or prescribed treatments.</p><div class="toc">
