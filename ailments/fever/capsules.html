<h2 id="1">1. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support immune function.</p><p>While it is traditionally used to prevent or reduce the severity of colds and flu, its role in treating fever is less well-established. Some studies suggest that echinacea may help reduce the duration of viral infections, which could indirectly assist in managing fever symptoms. However, there is limited scientific evidence specifically supporting its effectiveness for fever reduction.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/zingiber-officinale-capsules.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, is often used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic effects, including reducing fever.</p><p>Ginger capsules are a convenient form of this herb, allowing for easy consumption and consistent dosing. While ginger is not a substitute for conventional fever-reducing medications, some studies suggest it may help lower body temperature and alleviate symptoms associated with fever. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using ginger capsules for fever, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Black elderberry (Sambucus nigra)</h2><img alt="sambucus nigra capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/sambucus-nigra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Sambucus nigra, also known as European elderberry, is commonly used in herbal medicine for its potential antiviral and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>When formulated into capsules, it is often taken to support the body during viral infections, including those that cause fever. The berries contain compounds such as flavonoids and anthocyanins, which may help reduce inflammation and lower body temperature. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using elderberry supplements, especially for prolonged periods or in high doses.</p><p>While some studies suggest it may alleviate symptoms of fever, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for this specific use.</p><h2 id="4">4. Peppermint (Mentha piperita)</h2><img alt="mentha piperita capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/mentha-piperita-capsules.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal remedies for its cooling and soothing properties.</p><p>Peppermint herbal capsules are believed to help reduce fever by promoting sweating and improving circulation. These capsules are typically made from dried peppermint leaves and are free from artificial additives, making them a natural alternative to conventional fever treatments. While they may provide symptomatic relief, they should not replace professional medical advice, especially for high or persistent fevers.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hypericin and hyperforin, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties that might indirectly support the immune system. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using hypericum perforatum for fever, as it can interact with various medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>Overall, while hypericum perforatum herbal capsules may offer some supportive benefits, they should not replace conventional medical treatment for fever.</p><h2 id="6">6. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cinnamomum-verum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>When encapsulated as herbal capsules, Cinnamomum verum may help in managing fever due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. The essential oils in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, are believed to support the body's immune response and reduce inflammatory markers associated with fever. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon capsules for fever, especially for prolonged periods or in combination with other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest its supportive role, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in treating fever specifically.</p><h2 id="7">7. Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)</h2><img alt="thymus vulgaris capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/thymus-vulgaris-capsules.jpg"/><p>Thymus vulgaris, commonly known as thyme, is a herb that has been traditionally used for its antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>Thymus vulgaris herbal capsules are often formulated to support the body's natural defenses and may help alleviate symptoms associated with fever by promoting respiratory health and reducing inflammation.

Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hormonal balancing effects.</p><p>While it is often associated with menstrual regulation and mood support, its role in treating fever is less established. Some studies suggest that vitex may have mild antipyretic properties due to its phytochemical composition, which includes flavonoids and essential oils. However, there is limited clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for reducing fever specifically.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using vitex agnus-castus for fever or any other health condition.</p><h2 id="9">9. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/rosa-canina-capsules.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its ability to support the immune system.</p><p>Rosa canina herbal capsules are often formulated to provide a concentrated dose of the plant's beneficial compounds, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
