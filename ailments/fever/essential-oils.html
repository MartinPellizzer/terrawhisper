When used in diffusers or applied topically (with a carrier oil), eucalyptus globulus essential oil can help alleviate congestion and support the body's natural cooling processes. However, it is important to use it cautiously, as it may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>While it can be a complementary remedy for fever, it should not replace professional medical advice or treatment.</p><h2 id="2">2.
