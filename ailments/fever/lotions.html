These lotions are typically infused with extracts from the plant's flowers and roots, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. However, it's important to note that scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of echinacea purpurea lotions specifically for fever is limited.</p><p>As with any herbal product, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with allergies or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

These lotions may help alleviate fever-related discomfort by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation in the affected areas.</p><p>However, it is important to note that while St. John's Wort has been used historically, modern medical research on its efficacy for fever is limited, and it should be used with caution, especially when combined with other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4.
