They work by stimulating the skin's surface, creating a cooling sensation that may help lower the perception of body heat. While they can provide temporary relief, they are not a substitute for medical treatment in cases of severe or persistent fever.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or worsen, as herbal creams alone may not address the underlying cause of the fever.</p>
