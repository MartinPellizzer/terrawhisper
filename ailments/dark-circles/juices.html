<h2 id="1">1. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a nutrient-rich herb that has been traditionally used for its high concentration of vitamins, particularly vitamin C, which is essential for skin health.</p><p>When used in herbal juices, rosa canina can help brighten the under-eye area and reduce the appearance of dark circles by promoting collagen production and improving skin elasticity. The antioxidants present in rosehip juice also help combat oxidative stress, which can contribute to the formation of dark circles. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory properties of rosa canina may help reduce puffiness and swelling around the eyes, further enhancing the overall appearance of the under-eye area.</p><p>Incorporating rosa canina herbal juice into a daily skincare routine can offer a natural and effective approach to addressing the signs of fatigue and aging around the eyes.</p><h2 id="2">2. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a potent herbal plant that has been traditionally used for its rich nutritional and medicinal properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it can be beneficial for addressing dark circles due to its high content of chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals that promote skin health and circulation. The juice is believed to enhance blood flow to the under-eye area, which can help reduce the appearance of dark circles caused by poor circulation or fatigue. It also contains antioxidants that may protect the skin from oxidative stress and support a more even skin tone.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating stinging nettle juice into your skincare routine, especially if you have sensitive skin or existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal plant often used in the form of juice to support liver health and detoxification.</p><p>While primarily known for its liver benefits, some people use silybum marianum herbal juice to address dark circles under the eyes, believing it may improve circulation and reduce oxidative stress. The active compound, silymarin, is thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could potentially brighten the skin and reduce pigmentation. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking silybum marianum juice to the reduction of dark circles.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy often used in the form of juice to address various health concerns, including those related to the skin.</p><p>While it is primarily recognized for its hormonal balancing properties, some people use vitex agnus-castus herbal juice to help reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eyes, believing it may improve circulation and reduce inflammation. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for dark circles is limited, and results may vary among individuals. When considering this remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional to ensure safety and appropriateness for personal health needs.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, proper preparation and dosage are crucial to avoid potential side effects or interactions with other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thistle, is often used in herbal remedies for its potential benefits in improving circulation and reducing dark circles under the eyes.</p><p>This herb is believed to stimulate blood flow, which may help lighten the appearance of dark under-eye areas caused by poor circulation or fatigue. While there is limited scientific research on its effectiveness for dark circles, some traditional practices suggest that consuming blessed thistle in the form of herbal juices may support overall eye health. Herbal juices made from Cnicus benedictus are typically consumed internally, and they may also be applied topically as compresses to further enhance their effects.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating blessed thistle into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/matricaria-chamomilla-juices.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is often used in herbal juices to address the appearance of dark circles under the eyes.</p><p>This herb contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help reduce puffiness and improve circulation, potentially brightening the under-eye area. Chamomile juice is typically prepared by steeping dried flowers in water or using a cold-press method to retain its active components. When applied topically, it can soothe the skin and may help diminish the appearance of dark circles over time.</p><p>However, it is important to perform a patch test to avoid allergic reactions, as some individuals may be sensitive to chamomile.</p><h2 id="7">7. Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/camellia-sinensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green and black teas are derived, is often used in herbal juices for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These juices may help reduce the appearance of dark circles by improving circulation and reducing oxidative stress around the delicate under-eye area. The caffeine and polyphenols in Camellia sinensis can stimulate blood flow and brighten the skin, potentially diminishing the dullness associated with dark circles. However, it is important to note that while these juices may offer some benefits, they are not a substitute for proper skincare and lifestyle habits.</p><p>For best results, combining herbal juices with a consistent sleep schedule and a balanced diet is recommended.</p><h2 id="8">8. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/aloe-barbadensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a versatile herbal plant often used in skincare and health products due to its soothing and regenerative properties.</p><p>Aloe vera juice is believed to help reduce the appearance of dark circles by promoting skin hydration and improving blood circulation beneath the eyes. The gel contains enzymes and antioxidants that may help break down pigments and reduce inflammation, which are common causes of dark circles. It is often used topically as a face mask or applied directly to the under-eye area for its calming and nourishing effects.</p><p>While some people report benefits from using aloe vera juice for dark circles, individual results may vary, and it is best used as part of a comprehensive skincare routine.</p><h2 id="9">9. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been widely used in traditional medicine for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal juices, it can help reduce the appearance of dark circles by improving circulation and reducing oxidative stress around the eyes. The active compound curcumin in turmeric may help brighten the skin and lighten hyperpigmentation associated with dark circles. To maximize its benefits, turmeric is often combined with other ingredients like ginger, lemon, or honey in homemade herbal juices.</p><p>Regular consumption of these juices may support overall skin health and potentially alleviate the appearance of dark circles over time.</p><h2 id="10">10. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare)</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/foeniculum-vulgare-juices.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its potential benefits in reducing dark circles under the eyes.</p><p>The essential oils and compounds in fennel, such as anethole and estragole, are believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help lighten pigmentation and improve skin texture. When used in the form of herbal juices, fennel can be applied topically to the under-eye area to promote circulation and reduce the appearance of dark circles. However, it is important to dilute the juice with water or a carrier oil to avoid irritation, as concentrated fennel juice may cause sensitivity.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports its use, more scientific research is needed to fully validate its effectiveness for this specific application.</p>
