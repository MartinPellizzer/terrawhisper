Regular consumption of these teas may support skin health by promoting collagen production and reducing oxidative damage. However, while some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness specifically for dark circles.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating Camellia sinensis teas into a skincare or wellness routine.</p><h2 id="2">2. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a herbal ingredient widely used in teas for its rich content of antioxidants, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, rosa canina can help improve circulation and reduce oxidative stress, which are key factors in the appearance of dark circles under the eyes. The high levels of vitamin C in rosehips support collagen production, promoting skin health and a more even complexion.

The tea is thought to promote circulation, which could potentially alleviate the appearance of dark circles by reducing puffiness and enhancing blood flow to the delicate under-eye area. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to the reduction of dark circles is limited, and results may vary among individuals.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn or St. Benedict's thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in reducing dark circles under the eyes.</p><p>This herb is believed to improve circulation and strengthen the delicate skin around the eyes, which can help diminish the appearance of dark circles caused by poor blood flow or fatigue.
