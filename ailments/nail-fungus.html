<p>Nail fungus is a common fungal infection that affects the nails, causing thickening, discoloration, and brittleness.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat nail fungus, offering a natural and effective alternative to conventional treatments.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as tea tree oil, lavender oil, and oregano oil possess antifungal properties that help combat fungal infections, while herbs like turmeric, ginger, and garlic have anti-inflammatory properties that aid in healing.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like essential oil blends, tinctures, and salves can be used topically to treat nail fungus, and herbal supplements like probiotics and omega-3 fatty acids can be taken internally to support overall health and nail strength.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes nail fungus?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of nail fungus are fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton and Epidermophyton, which thrive in warm, moist environments and feed on keratin found in nails and skin.</p>
<p>Secondary causes can include weakened immune systems, poor hygiene, and sharing personal care items, which can spread the infection.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing nail fungus include wearing tight or poorly ventilated shoes, working in humid environments, and engaging in activities that expose the feet to water, such as swimming or showering frequently.</p>
<p>Additionally, people with diabetes, circulatory issues, or a history of nail biting or picking may also be more susceptible to nail fungus due to their compromised nail health.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal nail fungus?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat nail fungus are often rich in antimicrobial and antifungal compounds that help combat the infection.</p>
<p>Teatree oil, obtained from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, has been traditionally used to treat nail fungus due to its antimicrobial properties and the presence of bioactive compounds such as terpinen-4-ol, which inhibit fungal growth.</p>
<p>The herb Berberis aquifolium, also known as Oregon grape root, contains berberine, a bioactive compound that has been shown to exhibit antifungal activity by disrupting fungal cell membranes and inhibiting protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Additionally, the herb Usnea barbata, a type of lichen, contains usnic acid, which has been found to exhibit antifungal properties and inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat nail fungus?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat nail fungus are diverse and often used in the form of teas, infusions, and topical oils.</p>
<p>Some remedies involve soaking the affected nails in a warm solution of herbal extracts, such as those derived from trees and shrubs, which have antifungal properties.</p>
<p>Other treatments include applying a mixture of herbal oils and waxes to the nail, made from plants that have been traditionally used to combat fungal infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations, like decoctions and infusions, are consumed orally to help boost the body's natural defenses against fungal growth.</p>
