<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential to support gum health.</p><p>Herbal tinctures made from salvia officinalis may help reduce inflammation and promote healing in cases of bleeding gums due to their antimicrobial and astringent properties. These tinctures can be applied directly to the gums or used as a mouth rinse to soothe irritation and prevent infection. While they are generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Incorporating salvia officinalis tinctures into a holistic oral care routine may offer natural support for maintaining healthy gums.</p><h2 id="2">2. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tincture" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herb traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p><p>While primarily known for its use in treating mild depression, it has also been explored for its potential to support gum health. Hypericum perforatum tinctures may help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair in cases of bleeding gums, possibly due to their high concentration of flavonoids and hypericin. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using St. John's wort, as it can interact with certain medications.</p><p>Overall, while not a substitute for professional dental care, hypericum perforatum tinctures may offer complementary support for individuals experiencing gum issues.</p><h2 id="3">3. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tincture" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential healing properties.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, it may offer a natural remedy for bleeding gums due to its high concentration of minerals and antioxidants. The tincture is typically made by soaking fresh or dried nettle leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds to be extracted over time. Some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory and astringent properties of nettle may help reduce gum inflammation and promote healing.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using nettle tinctures, as they may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis herbal tinctures are traditionally used to support oral health and address issues such as bleeding gums due to their anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p><p>These tinctures contain compounds like flavonoids and triterpenes, which help reduce gum inflammation and promote healing. When applied topically to the gums, calendula tinctures can soothe irritation and strengthen the gum tissue, making them a natural alternative to conventional treatments. However, it is important to dilute the tincture properly before use to avoid irritation, as undiluted calendula can be harsh on sensitive oral tissues.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, consulting a healthcare professional is recommended, especially for individuals with existing oral conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tincture" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal tinctures are commonly used for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties, which may support gum health.</p><p>While there is limited direct evidence that echinacea tinctures specifically stop bleeding gums, they may help reduce inflammation and promote healing in the mouth. Some individuals use echinacea as a complementary therapy to support overall oral hygiene and reduce the risk of gum infections. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medications.</p><p>For persistent bleeding gums, it is crucial to seek professional dental care to address underlying causes such as gingivitis or periodontal disease.</p><h2 id="6">6. Sanguisorba officinalis</h2><img alt="sanguisorba officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/sanguisorba-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Sanguisorba officinalis, commonly known as lesser burnet, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Herbal tinctures made from Sanguisorba officinalis are often prepared by soaking the dried plant in alcohol to extract its active compounds, including tannins and flavonoids. These tinctures are believed to help reduce bleeding gums by promoting tissue healing and strengthening the gum structure. They are typically used as a mouth rinse or applied topically to the affected areas.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports their use for gum health, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating them into a treatment regimen.</p><h2 id="7">7. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tincture" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been traditionally used for its soothing and healing properties, and its herbal tinctures are increasingly being explored for their potential benefits in treating bleeding gums.</p><p>These tinctures contain various bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, enzymes, and antioxidants, which may help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair in the gums. Some studies suggest that aloe vera can help strengthen the gum tissue and improve oral health by reducing bacterial growth and plaque buildup. However, while anecdotal evidence supports its use, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for bleeding gums.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using aloe barbadensis tinctures, especially if you have underlying medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tincture" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is often used in herbal tinctures to support hormonal balance and may help alleviate symptoms related to hormonal fluctuations that can contribute to bleeding gums.</p><p>While not a direct treatment for gum bleeding, its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may support overall oral health by reducing gum inflammation and promoting healing. Herbal tinctures containing vitex are typically taken orally and are often used as part of a holistic approach to managing gum issues, especially in women experiencing hormonal changes such as those during menstruation or menopause. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex tinctures, as they may interact with certain medications or conditions.</p><p>Overall, while vitex agnus-castus may offer supportive benefits for gum health, it should be used in conjunction with proper dental care and professional treatment for persistent bleeding gums.</p><h2 id="9">9. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tincture" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support gum health and promote healing in cases of bleeding gums.</p><p>Its tinctures are prepared from the hips and flowers of the Rosa canina plant, which are rich in vitamin C, bioflavonoids, and other essential nutrients that help strengthen blood vessels and reduce inflammation. These tinctures are often used in alternative medicine to address gingival issues by improving circulation and enhancing the body's natural healing processes. When used as part of a holistic oral care routine, Rosa canina tinctures may help reduce gum bleeding and support overall oral health.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially if you have underlying medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.

When applied topically, chamomile tinctures may soothe irritated gum tissue and decrease bleeding caused by gingivitis or minor injuries. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using chamomile tinctures, especially if you have known allergies or are taking other medications.</p><p>While some people find relief with this natural remedy, it should not replace professional dental care for persistent bleeding gums.</p>
