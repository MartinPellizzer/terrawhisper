Sage contains antimicrobial and astringent properties that may help prevent bacterial infections and promote healing in the mouth. Herbal baths with sage can be a natural alternative to conventional treatments for mild gum irritation.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage baths, especially for persistent or severe gum bleeding.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica bath" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-baths.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal baths for its potential to soothe and heal inflamed or bleeding gums.</p><p>The leaves of this plant contain compounds such as silica and antioxidants that may help strengthen gum tissue and reduce inflammation. To prepare a stinging nettle bath, fresh or dried leaves are boiled in water and then cooled to a comfortable temperature before being used for rinsing the mouth or applying as a compress. While some anecdotal evidence suggests it may promote healing, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing oral conditions.</p><p>Although not a substitute for professional dental care, stinging nettle baths may offer a natural, complementary approach to supporting gum health.</p><h2 id="3">3. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum bath" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-baths.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, has been traditionally used in herbal baths for its potential soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When infused into bath water, it may help reduce irritation and promote healing in cases of bleeding gums by alleviating inflammation and supporting tissue repair. The active compounds in hypericum, such as hypericin and flavonoids, are believed to have antimicrobial and astringent effects that can help manage oral health issues. However, it is important to note that while some anecdotal evidence suggests its benefits, scientific research on its effectiveness for bleeding gums is limited.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals taking medications or with existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="4">4. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, making it a popular choice for herbal baths aimed at addressing bleeding gums.</p><p>When infused into warm water, calendula can help reduce gum inflammation and promote healing by encouraging blood circulation and tissue repair. Its antimicrobial properties may also help prevent infections that can exacerbate gum bleeding. Herbal baths with calendula are often recommended as a complementary therapy alongside proper oral hygiene practices.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using calendula baths, especially for those with known allergies or underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of rose hips may help strengthen the connective tissues around the gums, reducing the likelihood of bleeding. To use Rosa canina in a bath, steep the dried berries in boiling water for several hours, then add the infusion to warm bath water.</p><p>While herbal baths can be a complementary therapy, they should not replace professional dental care, especially for persistent or severe gum issues.</p><h2 id="6">6. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis bath" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-baths.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been traditionally used for its soothing and healing properties, making it a popular choice for herbal baths aimed at addressing bleeding gums.</p><p>When incorporated into a bath, the gel from the aloe vera plant can help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair, offering gentle relief to irritated gum tissues. The antibacterial properties of aloe vera may also help prevent infections and support overall oral health. To use aloe barbadensis in a bath, one can mix a small amount of pure aloe gel with warm water, ensuring the skin is exposed to its benefits without direct contact with the open wounds on the gums.</p><p>While herbal baths can complement oral care routines, they should not replace professional dental treatment for persistent bleeding gums.</p><h2 id="7">7. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita bath" src="/images/preparations/chamomilla-recutita-baths.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, has been traditionally used for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a popular choice for herbal baths aimed at addressing bleeding gums.</p><p>When infused into bath water, chamomile can help reduce inflammation and promote healing by calming the sensitive tissues in the mouth. The aromatic compounds in chamomile may also have a calming effect on the entire body, which can indirectly support oral health by reducing stress-related dental issues. However, while chamomile baths may provide some relief, they should not replace professional dental care for persistent or severe bleeding gums.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of bleeding gums and to ensure a comprehensive treatment plan.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus bath" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-baths.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in supporting hormonal balance and overall oral health.</p><p>When used in herbal baths, it may help soothe inflamed gums and reduce bleeding by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation. The infusion of vitex leaves and flowers can be added to warm water, creating a calming and therapeutic bath that supports the body's natural healing processes. While there is limited scientific research specifically on vitex for bleeding gums, its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties may contribute to improved gum health.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating vitex into a treatment regimen for gum issues.</p><h2 id="9">9. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense bath" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-baths.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to promote healing of bleeding gums due to its high concentration of silica and astringent properties.</p><p>The silica in horsetail helps strengthen connective tissues and may aid in the repair of gum tissue, while its astringent effects can reduce inflammation and bleeding. To prepare a herbal bath, a handful of dried horsetail can be simmered in water for several minutes, then allowed to cool before being used for rinsing the mouth or applying as a compress. While some anecdotal evidence supports its use, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using horsetail, especially for persistent or severe gum bleeding.</p><p>Overall, horsetail herbal baths may offer a natural complement to conventional treatments for gum health.</p><h2 id="10">10. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea bath" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-baths.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal baths, echinacea may help soothe irritated gums and reduce inflammation associated with bleeding gums.
