<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/salvia-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its astringent properties, which can help reduce bleeding gums by tightening the gum tissue.</p><p>Herbal juices made from fresh or dried sage leaves contain compounds like tannins and flavonoids that may promote healing and reduce inflammation. These juices can be consumed orally or applied directly to the gums to soothe irritation and stop minor bleeding. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using sage juice, especially for prolonged periods, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>While sage may offer some natural relief for bleeding gums, it should not replace professional dental care.</p><h2 id="2">2. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/aloe-barbadensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been traditionally used for its soothing and healing properties, including its potential benefits for oral health.</p><p>Aloe vera juice contains enzymes, vitamins, and minerals that can help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair, making it a natural remedy for bleeding gums. When applied topically or consumed as a juice, it may help strengthen the gums and improve overall mouth health. Some studies suggest that aloe vera can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, which may contribute to gum disease.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using aloe vera juice for persistent or severe bleeding gums, as it may interact with other medications or conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its potential healing properties, including its possible benefits for oral health.</p><p>Some herbal preparations made from stinging nettle, such as juices or teas, are believed to support gum health due to their high content of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients may help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair, which could be beneficial for individuals experiencing bleeding gums. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle juice, as it may interact with certain medications or have adverse effects for some individuals.</p><p>While preliminary research suggests possible benefits, more scientific studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of urtica dioica in treating bleeding gums.</p><h2 id="4">4. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/echinacea-purpurea-juices.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used to support immune function and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is traditionally used for colds and infections, some studies suggest that echinacea may have properties that promote healing and reduce gum inflammation. Herbal juices made from echinacea can be consumed internally to potentially aid in the recovery of bleeding gums by improving oral health and reducing bacterial presence. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Although promising, echinacea should not replace professional dental care for persistent or severe gum issues.</p><h2 id="5">5. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herb that has been traditionally used for various health purposes, including supporting hormonal balance.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for bleeding gums, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties may help reduce gum inflammation and promote healing. Herbal juices made from vitex can be used as a natural remedy to soothe irritated gums and improve oral health. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Combining vitex herbal juice with good oral hygiene practices can contribute to better gum health and overall well-being.</p><h2 id="6">6. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/hypericum-perforatum-juices.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herb that has been traditionally used for its potential healing properties.</p><p>While it is often associated with mood support, some studies suggest that it may also have benefits for oral health, including the treatment of bleeding gums. The active compounds in hypericum perforatum, such as hyperforin and hypericin, are believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can help reduce gum inflammation and prevent bacterial infections. When prepared as a herbal juice, it can be applied topically to the gums to promote healing and reduce bleeding.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using hypericum perforatum, as it may interact with certain medications and is not a substitute for professional dental care.</p><h2 id="7">7. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as dog rose, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support gum health and reduce bleeding.</p><p>The fruit of the Rosa canina plant is rich in vitamin C, bioflavonoids, and other antioxidants, which can help strengthen blood vessel walls and promote healing. When consumed as a herbal juice, Rosa canina can help improve circulation and reduce inflammation in the gums, making it beneficial for those experiencing bleeding gums. This natural remedy is often recommended as a complementary approach to conventional dental care.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating Rosa canina into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, making it a potential natural remedy for bleeding gums.</p><p>Ginger contains compounds like gingerol and shogaol, which can help reduce inflammation and promote healing in the gums. When consumed as a herbal juice, ginger can support oral health by improving blood circulation and reducing bacterial growth in the mouth. To prepare ginger juice, fresh ginger root is typically grated and blended with water or a small amount of honey for better taste.</p><p>While ginger juice may offer some relief for mild cases of bleeding gums, it is advisable to consult a dentist or healthcare professional for persistent or severe gum issues.</p><h2 id="9">9. Rosmarinus officinalis</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/rosmarinus-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a fragrant herb that has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including its potential benefits for oral health.</p><p>Rosemary herbal juices are rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and essential oils that may help reduce gum inflammation and promote healing. These juices can be used as a natural remedy to support gum health by soothing irritation and preventing bacterial growth. Regular consumption of rosemary juice may help strengthen the gums and reduce bleeding associated with conditions like gingivitis.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using rosemary juice as a treatment for bleeding gums, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="10">10. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/silybum-marianum-juices.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting oral health.</p><p>While it is well-known for its liver-protecting properties, some studies suggest that silybum marianum may also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that could help in reducing gum inflammation and bleeding. Herbal juices made from silybum marianum are sometimes recommended as a natural supplement to promote healing in the gums. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these juices, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking silybum marianum juice to the treatment of bleeding gums, so it should not be considered a substitute for professional dental care.</p>
