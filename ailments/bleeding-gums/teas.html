Herbal teas made from vitex are often used to promote hormonal balance, which might indirectly support oral health by reducing stress-related gum issues. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex for bleeding gums, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Overall, while vitex may be a complementary option for some, it should not replace standard dental care or professional treatment for gum conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
