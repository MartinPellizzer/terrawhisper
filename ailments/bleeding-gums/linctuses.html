<h2 id="1">1. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/salvia-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Sage-based linctuses are often recommended for individuals experiencing bleeding gums, as they can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. The active compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to soothe irritated mucous membranes. When used as a herbal linctus, sage can provide a soothing effect that may help minimize gum bleeding and improve oral hygiene.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage-based products, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with certain medical conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/echinacea-purpurea-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used for its potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with colds and infections, some herbal linctuses containing echinacea purpurea may be used to soothe irritated gums and reduce bleeding caused by inflammation or gingivitis. These linctuses typically combine echinacea with other soothing ingredients like licorice root or marshmallow root to enhance their calming effects on the oral mucosa. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting echinacea's effectiveness for gum bleeding is limited, and its use should be discussed with a healthcare provider, especially for individuals with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, proper dosage and potential interactions should be carefully considered.</p><h2 id="3">3.

When used as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it can be applied directly to the gums to soothe irritation and reduce bleeding. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using it, as it may interact with other medications.</p><p>Overall, Hypericum perforatum linctus may offer a natural alternative for managing bleeding gums, though its efficacy and safety should be evaluated on an individual basis.</p><h2 id="4">4.

However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using it for bleeding gums, as it may interact with other medications or conditions.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence suggests potential benefits, scientific research on its effectiveness for this specific use is limited.</p><h2 id="5">5. Marigold (Calendula officinalis)</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/calendula-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, making it a popular ingredient in herbal linctuses for addressing bleeding gums.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain extracts or oils from the flowers of the plant, which are known to promote tissue healing and reduce irritation. When applied directly to the gums, calendula-based linctuses can help alleviate inflammation and bleeding caused by gingivitis or other oral irritations. The antiseptic and astringent qualities of calendula may also help prevent infection and support overall oral health.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies, especially for persistent or severe gum bleeding.</p><h2 id="6">6. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/rosa-canina-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina herbal linctus, derived from the rosehip plant, is traditionally used to support gum health and reduce bleeding.</p><p>It contains high levels of vitamin C and bioflavonoids, which help strengthen blood vessels and promote tissue repair.

Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/aloe-barbadensis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been traditionally used for its soothing and healing properties, and it can be beneficial in the form of a herbal linctus for individuals experiencing bleeding gums.</p><p>The gel extracted from the aloe plant contains anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds that help reduce gum irritation and prevent infections. When applied topically as a linctus, it can provide a protective barrier over the gums, promoting faster healing and reducing the likelihood of further bleeding. Its gentle nature makes it suitable for regular use without causing irritation, making it a natural alternative to conventional treatments.</p><p>Incorporating aloe barbadensis linctus into a daily oral care routine may support overall gum health and alleviate symptoms associated with gingival inflammation.</p><h2 id="9">9. St. john's wort (Agrimonia eupatoria)</h2><img alt="agrimonia eupatoria linctuse" src="/images/preparations/linctuses/agrimonia-eupatoria-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Agrimonia eupatoria, also known as agrimony, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into a linctus, or herbal syrup, agrimonia eupatoria can help soothe irritated gums and reduce bleeding by promoting tissue healing and decreasing capillary fragility. The active compounds in agrimony, such as tannins and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to tighten blood vessels and reduce bleeding. This herbal remedy is often recommended for individuals experiencing mild gum bleeding due to conditions like gingivitis or during the early stages of periodontal disease.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using agrimonia eupatoria linctus, especially if symptoms persist or if there are underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="10">10.
