<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis linctuse" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Sage-based linctuses are often recommended for individuals experiencing bleeding gums, as they can help reduce inflammation and promote healing. The active compounds in sage, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to soothe irritated mucous membranes. When used as a herbal linctus, sage can provide a soothing effect that may help minimize gum bleeding and improve oral hygiene.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage-based products, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with certain medical conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea linctuse" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used for its potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with colds and infections, some herbal linctuses containing echinacea purpurea may be used to soothe irritated gums and reduce bleeding caused by inflammation or gingivitis. These linctuses typically combine echinacea with other soothing ingredients like licorice root or marshmallow root to enhance their calming effects on the oral mucosa. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting echinacea's effectiveness for gum bleeding is limited, and its use should be discussed with a healthcare provider, especially for individuals with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, proper dosage and potential interactions should be carefully considered.</p><h2 id="3">3.

When used as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it can be applied directly to the gums to soothe irritation and reduce bleeding. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using it, as it may interact with other medications.</p><p>Overall, Hypericum perforatum linctus may offer a natural alternative for managing bleeding gums, though its efficacy and safety should be evaluated on an individual basis.</p><h2 id="4">4.

This natural remedy is often recommended for individuals experiencing mild gum inflammation or bleeding due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Its gentle nature makes it suitable for regular use without causing irritation, making it a natural alternative to conventional treatments.</p><p>Incorporating aloe barbadensis linctus into a daily oral care routine may support overall gum health and alleviate symptoms associated with gingival inflammation.</p><h2 id="9">9. Agrimonia eupatoria</h2><img alt="agrimonia eupatoria linctuse" src="/images/preparations/agrimonia-eupatoria-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Agrimonia eupatoria, also known as agrimony, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into a linctus, or herbal syrup, agrimonia eupatoria can help soothe irritated gums and reduce bleeding by promoting tissue healing and decreasing capillary fragility. The active compounds in agrimony, such as tannins and flavonoids, contribute to its ability to tighten blood vessels and reduce bleeding. This herbal remedy is often recommended for individuals experiencing mild gum bleeding due to conditions like gingivitis or during the early stages of periodontal disease.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using agrimonia eupatoria linctus, especially if symptoms persist or if there are underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="10">10.
