These teas work by stimulating the kidneys to eliminate excess fluids from the body, which can alleviate swelling in the legs, ankles, and hands. While herbal teas are generally safe, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>Incorporating herbal teas into a balanced diet and lifestyle can support overall fluid balance and contribute to better management of edema.</p><div class="toc">
