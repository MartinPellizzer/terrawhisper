Their ability to absorb excess fluid can aid in reducing swelling, particularly in conditions like inflammation of the throat or digestive tract. Additionally, mucillages are generally safe for most individuals when used in appropriate amounts, though they should be taken with sufficient water to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort.</p><p>As complementary therapies, herbal mucillages may be beneficial when used alongside conventional treatments for edema under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><div class="toc">
