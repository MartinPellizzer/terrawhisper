While some studies suggest that comfrey may help alleviate fluid retention and improve circulation, it is important to note that the use of Symphytum officinale tinctures should be approached with caution due to potential toxicity from pyrrolizidine alkaloids, especially with long-term or excessive use. As a result, it is generally recommended for short-term use under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider.</p><p>Despite its historical use, modern herbal practices often advise against internal consumption of comfrey tinctures due to safety concerns, though topical applications may be considered with proper precautions.</p><h2 id="8">8.
