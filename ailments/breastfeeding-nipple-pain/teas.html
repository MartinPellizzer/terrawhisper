It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using milk thistle, especially during breastfeeding, to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><p>Although there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to relief of nipple pain, it may be considered as part of a broader approach to managing breast discomfort.</p><h2 id="10">10. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it may help alleviate nipple pain experienced during breastfeeding by reducing inflammation and soothing irritated skin.
