While scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited, many users report a noticeable improvement in their sleep quality and reduced nighttime noise. Herbal creams made with valerian are often marketed as natural alternatives to over-the-counter and prescription snoring remedies.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such products, especially if snoring is a symptom of a more serious condition like sleep apnea.</p><h2 id="2">2. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/matricaria-chamomilla-creams.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a herbal ingredient often used in topical creams for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When incorporated into creams, chamomile can help soothe the skin and reduce irritation, which may indirectly support better sleep by promoting relaxation.
