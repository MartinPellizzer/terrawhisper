The active compounds in chamomile, such as apigenin, may help reduce stress and anxiety, which are common contributors to snoring. By calming the nervous system, these capsules may help relax the throat muscles, thereby reducing the frequency and intensity of snoring.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using chamomile capsules, especially for those with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

The herb contains compounds like valerenic acid and essential oils that may help relax throat muscles and reduce the vibrations that cause snoring. While some studies suggest valerian may have mild sedative effects, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy specifically for snoring.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Some studies suggest that the compound glycyrrhizin in licorice root may have a mild effect on reducing mucus production and relaxing the muscles in the upper airway. However, it is important to note that while licorice root may offer some relief for snoring, it is not a cure and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it may interact with medications or have side effects, particularly when consumed in large amounts or over prolonged periods.</p><h2 id="5">5.

However, it is important to note that scientific evidence directly linking Vitex to the reduction of snoring is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and recent studies suggest it may help reduce snoring by addressing underlying inflammation in the airways.</p><p>The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, can help decrease swelling in the throat and nasal passages, which are common contributors to snoring.
