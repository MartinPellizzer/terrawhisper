Soaking in warm water infused with these herbs can ease muscle tension and improve blood circulation, potentially easing the pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter. While herbal baths are not a cure for heartburn, they can complement other treatments and provide relief from the discomfort associated with acid reflux.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before using herbal remedies, especially if heartburn is persistent or severe.</p><div class="toc">
