Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum tincture" src="/images/preparations/tinctures/cinnamomum-verum-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in alleviating heartburn.</p><p>The tinctures derived from its bark contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, which may help reduce inflammation and soothe the digestive tract.

Peppermint (Mentha piperita)</h2><img alt="mentha piperita tincture" src="/images/preparations/tinctures/mentha-piperita-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal tinctures to alleviate symptoms of heartburn due to its calming and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>The tinctures work by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter, which can help reduce the sensation of burning and discomfort associated with acid reflux. Peppermint's essential oils, such as menthol, stimulate the release of digestive enzymes and may aid in improving digestion, thereby reducing the likelihood of heartburn. However, it is important to note that some individuals may experience worsened heartburn due to the relaxing effect on the sphincter, so it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use.</p><p>Overall, peppermint tinctures can be a natural and effective option for managing mild heartburn when used appropriately.</p>
