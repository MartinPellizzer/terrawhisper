Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium linctuse" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.</p><p>When prepared as a linctus, or herbal syrup, it may offer a soothing and effective remedy for joint pain due to its high concentration of compounds like achillene and flavonoids. This preparation is often favored for its ease of consumption and potential for prolonged absorption, which can help reduce inflammation and alleviate discomfort in conditions such as arthritis.

However, it is important to note that while some anecdotal evidence supports its use, scientific research on its efficacy for joint pain is limited.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it should be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare practitioner to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7. Boswellia serrata</h2><img alt="boswellia serrata linctuse" src="/images/preparations/boswellia-serrata-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Boswellia serrata, also known as Indian frankincense, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into linctuses, it provides a convenient and soothing method of delivering its active compounds to the body.

The active compounds in licorice root, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, contribute to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, long-term use of licorice-based linctuses may lead to side effects like hypertension or fluid retention due to its potent corticosteroid-like effects.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, glycyrrhiza glabra linctuses may offer natural relief for joint pain when used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="10">10.
