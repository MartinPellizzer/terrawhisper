These decoctions are traditionally used to alleviate symptoms of stress, anxiety, and insomnia due to the presence of compounds like valerenic acid and volatile oils. The sedative effects of valerian are believed to work by increasing the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, promoting relaxation.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using valerian, especially for prolonged periods or in combination with other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Scutellaria lateriflora</h2><img alt="scutellaria lateriflora decoction" src="/images/preparations/scutellaria-lateriflora-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Scutellaria lateriflora, commonly known as blue flags, is a traditional herbal remedy used for its calming effects on the nervous system.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from the roots and leaves of Scutellaria lateriflora are often prepared by simmering the plant material in water for several hours to extract its active compounds.
