Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium linctuse" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into linctuses, these herbal preparations can provide soothing relief for stress-related symptoms, such as anxiety and irritability.
