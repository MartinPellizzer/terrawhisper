<h2 id="1">1. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum bath" src="/images/preparations/hypericum-perforatum-baths.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>While it is well-known for its use in treating mild depression, some historical sources suggest it may have been employed in baths to support overall health, including conditions like an enlarged spleen. The active compounds in hypericum, such as hypericin and hyperforin, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which could potentially aid in reducing inflammation associated with an enlarged spleen. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence directly linking hypericum perforatum baths to the treatment of spleen enlargement.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially for conditions involving the spleen, to ensure safety and appropriateness.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea bath" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-baths.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used in baths to support immune health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When infused into bath water, echinacea may help soothe the body and potentially alleviate symptoms associated with an enlarged spleen by reducing systemic inflammation.

To use sage in a bath, it can be steeped in hot water and then added to a tub, allowing the steam and aromatic compounds to be absorbed through the skin.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, especially for conditions like an enlarged spleen, to ensure safety and appropriateness.</p><h2 id="4">4. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica bath" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-baths.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal baths to support overall health, including conditions like an enlarged spleen.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as silica, potassium, and antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and support detoxification processes in the body.
