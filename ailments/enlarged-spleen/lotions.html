These lotions are typically applied externally and are thought to promote circulation and lymphatic drainage, which may indirectly aid in reducing spleen size. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy, as an enlarged spleen can be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition.</p><p>Always combine traditional herbal treatments with modern medical advice for safe and effective care.</p>

These lotions are believed to help reduce inflammation and promote detoxification, which may aid in cases of an enlarged spleen by supporting the body's natural cleansing processes. While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking Urtica dioica lotions to spleen health, some practitioners recommend them as a complementary therapy alongside conventional medical treatments.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Artemisia annua</h2><img alt="artemisia annua lotion" src="/images/preparations/artemisia-annua-lotions.jpg"/><p>Artemisia annua, a herb traditionally used in Chinese medicine, contains compounds like artemisinin that have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties.</p><p>Herbal lotions made from artemisia annua may support spleen health by reducing inflammation and improving lymphatic function, which is often compromised in cases of an enlarged spleen. While not a substitute for medical treatment, these lotions can be used as a complementary therapy under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider.
