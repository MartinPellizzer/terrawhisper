<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making it a valuable ingredient in herbal tinctures for treating inflamed mouths.</p><p>These tinctures are often prepared by soaking dried sage leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids to be extracted for therapeutic use. When applied topically, sage tinctures can help reduce swelling, soothe irritation, and promote healing in conditions like canker sores or gum inflammation. Due to its astringent properties, sage may also help tighten tissues and reduce excess mucus production, which is beneficial for oral health.</p><p>However, it is important to use sage tinctures with caution, as excessive use may cause dryness or irritation, and consulting a healthcare professional is recommended before incorporating them into a treatment regimen.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tincture" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal tinctures are commonly used to support the body's natural defenses and reduce inflammation, making them a popular choice for addressing inflamed mouths, such as those affected by canker sores or gingivitis.</p><p>These tinctures are typically made by soaking the dried roots and flowers of the echinacea plant in alcohol, which extracts its active compounds, including alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, and polysaccharides.

However, it is important to dilute the tincture properly before use, as undiluted nettle can cause further irritation.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using urtica dioica tinctures, especially if you have allergies or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra tincture" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, making it a popular ingredient in herbal tinctures for inflamed mouths.</p><p>These tinctures typically contain a concentrated form of the plant's extract, which can help reduce irritation, redness, and discomfort associated with conditions like canker sores or mouth ulcers. The active compounds, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, work by inhibiting inflammatory responses and promoting tissue healing. When applied topically, licorice root tinctures can provide rapid relief and support the mouth's natural healing process.</p><p>However, prolonged use should be monitored due to the potential for side effects, such as increased blood pressure, associated with excessive glycyrrhizin intake.</p><h2 id="7">7. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita tincture" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal tinctures to soothe inflamed mouths due to its cooling and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The tincture is typically prepared by steeping fresh or dried peppermint leaves in alcohol, allowing the active compounds like menthol and menthone to dissolve. These compounds help reduce pain and irritation by numbing the mucous membranes and decreasing swelling. Peppermint tinctures can be applied directly to the affected area using a cotton swab or diluted with water for safer use.</p><p>While generally safe, individuals with allergies to mint or other components should consult a healthcare provider before use.</p><h2 id="8">8. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tincture" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, has been widely used for its soothing and healing properties, particularly in the form of herbal tinctures for inflamed mouth conditions.</p><p>These tinctures are typically prepared by extracting the gel from the aloe leaf and combining it with alcohol to preserve its active compounds, which include vitamins, enzymes, and antioxidants. The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of aloe vera make it effective in reducing redness, swelling, and discomfort associated with mouth sores, ulcers, or irritations. When applied directly to the affected area, aloe barbadensis tinctures can promote tissue repair and provide a cooling, numbing effect that alleviates pain.</p><p>However, it is important to ensure proper dilution and to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for prolonged or severe oral inflammation.</p><h2 id="9">9.
