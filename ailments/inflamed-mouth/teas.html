The essential oils in sage, such as thujone and cineole, contribute to its ability to alleviate symptoms of mouth ulcers, canker sores, and gingivitis. When brewed and used as a mouth rinse or consumed as a tea, sage can provide natural relief and support oral health.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage tea, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with certain medical conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tea" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-teas.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used in teas to support immune health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, echinacea may help soothe inflamed mouth tissues due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The active compounds in echinacea, such as polysaccharides and flavonoids, are believed to contribute to its soothing effects on oral mucosa. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for individuals with allergies or those taking medications.</p><p>While some people find relief from mouth inflammation with echinacea tea, its effectiveness can vary, and it should not replace professional medical treatment.</p><h2 id="3">3. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green tea is derived, contains bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and catechins that possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>These compounds may help reduce inflammation in the mouth by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis, such as green tea or white tea, are often recommended for their soothing effects on oral mucosa. Regular consumption of these teas can potentially alleviate symptoms of inflamed mouth conditions like canker sores or gingivitis.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using Camellia sinensis-based teas as a treatment for persistent oral inflammation.</p><h2 id="4">4. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it can help reduce inflammation in the mouth, making it beneficial for conditions like canker sores or mouth ulcers. The tea is rich in antioxidants and minerals such as silica, which may support tissue healing and oral health. To prepare the tea, fresh or dried stinging nettle leaves are steeped in hot water for several minutes.</p><p>However, it is important to ensure the leaves are properly prepared to avoid irritation, as the plant contains compounds that can cause a stinging sensation when handled improperly.</p><h2 id="5">5.

When prepared as a tea, it can be gently applied to the affected areas or consumed to support overall mouth health. However, it is important to note that St. John's Wort may interact with certain medications, so consulting a healthcare professional before use is advisable.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, individual responses to the herb can vary, and it should not replace professional medical treatment for severe or persistent mouth inflammation.</p><h2 id="6">6. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal teas to soothe inflamed mouths due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>The gel extracted from the aloe plant contains compounds like polysaccharides and enzymes that help reduce swelling and promote healing in oral tissues. When brewed into a tea, aloe vera can provide a cooling effect that alleviates discomfort from mouth ulcers, canker sores, or gum irritation. However, it is important to use only the gel form and avoid the latex layer, which can be irritating.</p><p>While generally safe for short-term use, individuals with sensitive stomachs or allergies should consult a healthcare provider before incorporating aloe vera tea into their routine.</p><h2 id="7">7. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita tea" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-teas.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is a popular herb used in herbal teas to soothe inflamed mouths due to its cooling and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The essential oils in peppermint, particularly menthol, help reduce pain and irritation by numbing the affected areas and promoting a calming effect. Peppermint tea can be brewed by steeping fresh or dried leaves in hot water, making it a simple and accessible remedy for oral discomfort. Regular consumption of peppermint tea may also help alleviate symptoms of conditions like canker sores or gingivitis.</p><p>However, individuals with sensitive stomachs or certain medical conditions should consult a healthcare provider before using peppermint tea as a treatment.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cinnamomum zeylanicum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum zeylanicum tea" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-zeylanicum-teas.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum, commonly known as cinnamon, is often used in herbal teas to soothe inflamed mouths due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>The essential oils in cinnamon, particularly cinnamaldehyde, help reduce swelling and irritation in the oral cavity. When brewed into a warm tea, cinnamon can provide a comforting and calming effect on sore gums and mouth ulcers. It is typically combined with other soothing herbs like chamomile or licorice root to enhance its therapeutic benefits.</p><p>However, individuals with sensitive mouths should use cinnamon sparingly and consult a healthcare provider before regular use.</p><h2 id="9">9. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum tea" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-teas.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, is often used in herbal teas to address inflamed mouth conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>The essential oils in cinnamon, particularly cinnamaldehyde, help reduce swelling and discomfort in the oral cavity. When brewed into a tea, cinnamon can soothe irritated tissues and promote healing in cases of mouth ulcers or gingivitis. However, it is important to use it in moderation, as excessive consumption may cause irritation or allergic reactions.</p><p>This herbal tea can be a natural complement to conventional treatments for oral inflammation, though it should not replace professional dental care.</p><h2 id="10">10. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra tea" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-teas.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, is often used in herbal teas to soothe inflamed mouths due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>The tea is prepared by steeping dried licorice root in hot water, allowing the beneficial compounds such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids to be released. These compounds help reduce swelling, redness, and irritation in the oral cavity, making it a popular remedy for conditions like canker sores and gingivitis. However, prolonged use of licorice root tea may lead to side effects such as increased blood pressure due to its effect on the adrenal glands.</p><p>As a result, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice root tea for extended periods, especially for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions.</p>
