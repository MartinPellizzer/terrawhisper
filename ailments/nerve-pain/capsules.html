Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, and recent research suggests that sage herbal capsules may offer relief for nerve pain due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds.</p><p>The active components in salvia officinalis, such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, are believed to support nerve health and reduce oxidative stress, which is often associated with chronic pain conditions. While more clinical studies are needed, some preliminary evidence indicates that sage may help alleviate symptoms of neuropathic pain by modulating inflammatory responses in the nervous system.
