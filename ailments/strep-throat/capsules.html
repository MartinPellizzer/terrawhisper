While some studies suggest they may help reduce inflammation and support the body's natural defenses, their effectiveness in curing bacterial infections like strep throat is not well-established by scientific research. Many people use them alongside or instead of prescribed medications, but it is important to consult a healthcare provider to ensure they are safe and appropriate for individual health conditions.</p><p>Overall, herbal capsules can be a complementary option, but they should not replace professional medical advice or treatment for strep throat.</p><div class="toc">
