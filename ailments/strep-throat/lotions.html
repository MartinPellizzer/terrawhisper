While some herbs, such as echinacea or garlic, may have antimicrobial properties, they are not a substitute for medical treatment when it comes to strep throat. Using herbal lotions for this condition may provide only temporary relief of symptoms but does not target the underlying infection.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of strep throat to prevent complications.</p>
