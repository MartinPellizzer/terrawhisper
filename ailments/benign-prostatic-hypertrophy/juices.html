These juices are believed to work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is linked to prostate growth. While some studies suggest that herbal juices may offer mild relief from BPH symptoms, they are not a substitute for medical treatment and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Overall, herbal juices can be a complementary approach to conventional therapies, but their efficacy and safety require further scientific validation.</p><div class="toc">
