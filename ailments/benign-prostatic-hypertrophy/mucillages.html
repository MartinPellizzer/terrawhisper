Some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory and demulcent properties of these herbs may help alleviate urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia. While more research is needed to confirm their efficacy, herbal mucillages are often considered a natural and complementary approach to managing BPH.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using any herbal supplements, especially if taking other medications or undergoing treatment for BPH.</p><div class="toc">
