<p>Herbal baths for Benign prostatic hypertrophy are a non-invasive and natural treatment approach that involves soaking the body in warm water infused with various herbs to alleviate the symptoms of this condition.</p>

<p>Additionally, other herbs such as juniper berries, uva ursi, and couch grass are also used in these baths due to their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce the symptoms of BPH.</p>
