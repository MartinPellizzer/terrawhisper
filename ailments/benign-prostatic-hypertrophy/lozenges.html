<p>Herbal lozenges for Benign prostatic hypertrophy are a type of dietary supplement that are designed to alleviate the symptoms of BPH, a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland.</p>
<p>These lozenges typically contain a blend of herbs and botanicals such as saw palmetto, stinging nettle, pygeum, and beta-sitosterol, which have been shown to have a positive effect on prostate health by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to prostate enlargement.</p>
<p>The benefits of using herbal lozenges to treat BPH include improved urine flow, reduced frequency of urination, and a decrease in the sensation of urgency to urinate.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal lozenges that may be beneficial for BPH include saw palmetto lozenges, which contain the active compound saw palmetto extract, stinging nettle lozenges, which contain stinging nettle root, and beta-sitosterol lozenges, which contain the plant sterol beta-sitosterol, all of which work together to provide relief from the symptoms of BPH.</p>
