The active compounds in Cnidium monnieri, such as ligustilide and butylidenephthalide, may help improve urinary flow and reduce prostate enlargement. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these lozenges, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more clinical research is needed to fully understand their efficacy and safety in managing BPH.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Clinical studies suggest that pygeum africanum can alleviate symptoms associated with BPH, such as frequent urination and nighttime urination. The lozenges are often taken as a natural alternative or complementary therapy to conventional treatments.</p><p>Due to their mild side effect profile, they are considered a safe option for long-term management of BPH symptoms.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These lozenges may work by reducing inflammation and improving prostate function through their rich content of bioactive compounds like flavonoids and minerals. Clinical studies suggest that regular use of Urtica dioica lozenges can contribute to better urinary control and overall comfort in men with BPH.</p><p>As a natural alternative, these lozenges offer a complementary approach to conventional treatments, though consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended for optimal results.</p><h2 id="4">4. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may support prostate health.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing ginger extract are being explored as a complementary therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as they may help reduce urinary symptoms and inflammation associated with the condition. Some studies suggest that ginger's active compounds, such as gingerols and shogaols, could inhibit the growth of prostate cells and improve urinary flow. However, more clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in treating BPH.</p><p>While ginger lozenges are generally well-tolerated, individuals should consult a healthcare provider before using them as part of a treatment plan for BPH.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing glycyrrhiza glabra are often recommended for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) due to their potential to reduce prostate inflammation and improve urinary symptoms. These lozenges may help alleviate discomfort associated with BPH by supporting the body's natural inflammatory response and promoting overall prostate health. However, long-term use of licorice root can lead to side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under medical supervision.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, glycyrrhiza glabra lozenges may offer supportive benefits when used alongside conventional treatments for BPH.</p><h2 id="9">9. Tribulus terrestris</h2><img alt="tribulus terrestris lozenge" src="/images/preparations/tribulus-terrestris-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Tribulus terrestris herbal lozenges are a natural supplement derived from the seeds of the Tribulus terrestris plant, traditionally used in herbal medicine for various health purposes.</p><p>These lozenges are often marketed for their potential to support prostate health, particularly in managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland.
