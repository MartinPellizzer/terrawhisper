Some studies suggest that these oils could help reduce swelling and improve urinary flow by promoting hormonal balance and reducing oxidative stress. While they are often used as complementary therapies, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using essential oils, as they may interact with medications or have side effects.</p><p>Overall, herbal essential oils show promise in supporting BPH management, though more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety.</p><div class="toc">
