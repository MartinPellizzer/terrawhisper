<p>Herbal teas for Benign prostatic hypertrophy are a type of herbal remedy that is used to alleviate the symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland.</p>
<p>These teas are beneficial for treating this ailment as they contain anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidants, and other compounds that help to reduce swelling, ease urinary issues, and promote overall prostate health.</p>

<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as Green tea, Ginseng tea, and Flaxseed tea may also be beneficial in treating Benign prostatic hypertrophy due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
