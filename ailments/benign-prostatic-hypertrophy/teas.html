These herbs are believed to work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone associated with prostate growth. While some studies suggest that herbal teas may offer mild symptom relief, they are generally considered safe with fewer side effects compared to pharmaceutical treatments.</p><p>However, individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using herbal remedies to ensure they are appropriate for their specific health condition.</p><div class="toc">
