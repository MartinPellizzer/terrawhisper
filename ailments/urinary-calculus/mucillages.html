Some studies suggest that mucillages may assist in the prevention of stone formation by increasing urine volume and promoting the flushing of minerals from the urinary system. Additionally, certain mucillages possess mild diuretic properties that can enhance urinary flow and reduce the risk of stone recurrence.</p><p>However, while these natural remedies may offer supportive benefits, they should not replace professional medical treatment for existing urinary calculi.</p><div class="toc">
