Herbal baths infused with silybum marianum may help soothe discomfort and promote relaxation, potentially supporting the body's natural detoxification processes. However, it is important to note that silybum marianum should not replace conventional medical treatments for urinary calculus, and individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using it as part of a therapeutic regimen.</p><p>Overall, while there is some preliminary interest in its use, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating urinary calculus through herbal baths.</p><h2 id="7">7.
