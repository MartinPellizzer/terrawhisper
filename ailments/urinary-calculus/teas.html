These teas can also help reduce inflammation and prevent the formation of new stones by supporting kidney function and balancing mineral levels in the body. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using herbal teas, as they may interact with medications or exacerbate underlying conditions.</p><p>While herbal teas can be a complementary therapy, they should not replace medical treatment for more severe cases of urinary calculi.</p>

Some studies suggest that silymarin may help prevent the formation of certain types of kidney stones by inhibiting the crystallization of minerals in urine. While herbal teas made from Silybum marianum are generally considered safe, they should not replace conventional medical treatments for urinary calculus.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using milk thistle tea as a complementary therapy for kidney stones.</p><h2 id="3">3.
