Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, is a popular herbal ingredient often used in juices for its potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>However, some people find the natural earthy and bitter taste of turmeric in herbal juices unpleasant, which can make the drink less palatable.
