This process helps reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, mucillages can improve overall digestion and promote a feeling of fullness, which may aid in weight management, another key factor in cholesterol regulation.</p><p>Incorporating these herbal mucillages into a balanced diet, alongside regular physical activity and a healthy lifestyle, can be a beneficial complementary approach to managing high cholesterol.</p>
