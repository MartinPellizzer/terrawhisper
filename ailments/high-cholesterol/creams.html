<p>Herbal creams for high cholesterol are topical creams or ointments that contain plant extracts and herbs, which are used to lower cholesterol levels and improve cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>These creams are beneficial because they not only help to reduce cholesterol levels but also promote overall well-being by reducing stress, improving blood flow, and enhancing the immune system.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal creams that can be used to treat high cholesterol include turmeric cream, which contains curcumin that helps to reduce inflammation and improve lipid profiles; garlic cream, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help to lower cholesterol levels; and ginger cream, which aids in digestion and reduces inflammation; passionflower cream, which helps to reduce stress and anxiety; and aloe vera cream, which has anti-inflammatory properties that help to improve skin health.</p>
<p>Additionally, other examples of herbal creams include ginseng cream, which improves circulation and reduces stress, and saw palmetto cream, which has been shown to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that can raise cholesterol levels.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>
According to "Arzneimittel-Forschung", creams for high cholesterol containing water-soluble extracts of garlic powder may be beneficial in reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and export due to their inhibitory effect on HMGCoA-reductase.
