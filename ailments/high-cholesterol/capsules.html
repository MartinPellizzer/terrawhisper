Garlic (Allium sativum)</h2><img alt="allium sativum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/allium-sativum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, has been widely studied for its potential benefits in managing high cholesterol levels.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing garlic extract are often used as a natural supplement to support cardiovascular health by helping to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol. These capsules may work by inhibiting the enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis and promoting the breakdown of lipids in the body. While some research suggests garlic can modestly reduce cholesterol levels, individual responses may vary, and it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.</p><p>As with any dietary or herbal supplement, consistency in use and adherence to a healthy lifestyle are key factors in achieving optimal results.</p><h2 id="2">2. Common grape (Vitis vinifera)</h2><img alt="vitis vinifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitis-vinifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitis vinifera herbal capsules, derived from the grapevine plant, are traditionally used to support cardiovascular health and help manage high cholesterol levels.</p><p>These capsules contain resveratrol, a potent antioxidant known for its ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol. By promoting healthy lipid metabolism, Vitis vinifera may assist in lowering total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any herbal supplement, especially if you are on medication or have existing health conditions.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in cholesterol management.</p><h2 id="3">3. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, commonly known as milk thistle, is a herbal supplement often used for its potential liver-protective properties.</p><p>While it is not a primary treatment for high cholesterol, some studies suggest that it may support liver function, which can indirectly influence cholesterol metabolism. Herbal capsules containing silybum marianum are typically standardized to contain a specific amount of silymarin, the active compound believed to contribute to its health benefits. However, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in directly lowering cholesterol levels.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating silybum marianum into a cholesterol management plan.</p><h2 id="4">4. Salvia (Salvia officinalis)</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/salvia-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting cardiovascular health.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that sage may help lower cholesterol levels by improving lipid metabolism and reducing oxidative stress in the body. Herbal capsules containing standardized extracts of Salvia officinalis are increasingly being used as a natural supplement to complement conventional cholesterol-lowering treatments. These capsules are typically free from artificial additives and are available in various forms, including standardized and non-standardized extracts.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage supplements, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides)</h2><img alt="hippophae rhamnoides capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hippophae-rhamnoides-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hippophae rhamnoides, commonly known as sea buckthorn, is a shrub whose berries are used in herbal supplements, including capsules, to support cardiovascular health.</p><p>These capsules are often marketed for their potential to help manage high cholesterol levels due to the presence of bioactive compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids, and essential fatty acids. Studies suggest that sea buckthorn may help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, while supporting overall lipid metabolism. However, it is important to note that while some research shows promise, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for cholesterol management.</p><p>As with any supplement, individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using sea buckthorn capsules, especially if they have existing health conditions or are on medication.</p><h2 id="6">6. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)</h2><img alt="urtica dioica capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/urtica-dioica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a plant that has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including supporting cardiovascular health.</p><p>Urtica dioica herbal capsules are often marketed as natural supplements that may help in managing high cholesterol levels by promoting healthy lipid metabolism.

However, while some studies suggest possible benefits, more rigorous scientific research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for cholesterol management.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before starting Urtica dioica capsules, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those on medication.</p><h2 id="7">7. Gurmar (Gymnema sylvestre)</h2><img alt="gymnema sylvestre capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/gymnema-sylvestre-capsules.jpg"/><p>Gymnema sylvestre, also known as the "sugar destroyer," is a traditional Ayurvedic herb that has been used for centuries to support blood sugar regulation and may also offer benefits for managing high cholesterol.</p><p>Gymnema sylvestre herbal capsules are formulated to help reduce LDL cholesterol levels while promoting overall cardiovascular health. The herb contains compounds like gymnemic acids, which are believed to inhibit the absorption of sugars and fats in the intestines, potentially lowering cholesterol levels. Many people use these capsules as a natural complement to a healthy diet and lifestyle to support cholesterol management.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/zingiber-officinale-capsules.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, and recent studies suggest that ginger herbal capsules may help in managing high cholesterol levels.</p><p>The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerols and shogaols, are believed to inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the intestines. Clinical trials have shown that regular consumption of ginger capsules can lead to a modest but significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol. While ginger is generally considered safe, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating it into a cholesterol management plan, especially if you are on other medications.</p><p>Overall, ginger herbal capsules may serve as a complementary therapy to support heart health and cholesterol control.</p><h2 id="9">9. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a compound that has been studied for its potential benefits in managing high cholesterol.</p><p>Herbal capsules made from Curcuma longa are often used as a natural supplement to support cardiovascular health by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.

However, while some studies suggest curcumin may have modest effects on cholesterol, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and optimal dosage.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating Curcuma longa capsules into a cholesterol management plan.</p><h2 id="10">10. Dog rose (Rosa canina)</h2><img alt="rosa canina capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/rosa-canina-capsules.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rose hip, is a natural herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support cardiovascular health.</p><p>Rosa canina herbal capsules are often recommended for individuals with high cholesterol due to their high content of antioxidants, vitamins, and essential fatty acids. These capsules may help reduce LDL cholesterol levels and improve overall lipid profiles by promoting healthy cholesterol metabolism. Studies suggest that the polyphenols in rose hips can enhance the body's ability to manage cholesterol effectively.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, rosa canina capsules should be used alongside a balanced diet and lifestyle changes for optimal results.</p>
