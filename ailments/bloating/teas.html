alt="teas for bloating">
<p>Herbal teas for bloating are a natural remedy made from various herbs and plants that help alleviate discomfort, cramps, and gas associated with bloating.</p>
<p>These teas work by soothing the digestive system, reducing inflammation, and improving digestion, providing relief from bloating symptoms.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas that can help treat bloating include peppermint tea, which relaxes the muscles in the digestive tract, ginger tea, which reduces inflammation and nausea, chamomile tea, which calms the digestive system, and fennel tea, which helps to release gas and ease cramps.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as dandelion tea, licorice root tea, and slippery elm tea can also be beneficial in treating bloating, as they help to regulate bowel movements, soothe the digestive tract, and reduce inflammation.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>
According to the study, teas for bloating that may be beneficial include those containing flaxseed dietary fibers, which are fermented by gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids with prebiotic effects, and teas rich in tannins and anthocyanins, which are metabolized by gut bacteria to generate bioavailable metabolites that may exert a prebiotic-like effect on gut microbiota.
