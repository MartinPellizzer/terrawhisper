The active compound, glycyrrhizin, may help modulate digestive secretions and ease symptoms associated with nausea. These linctuses are typically used as a complementary therapy alongside other treatments for conditions like motion sickness or morning sickness.</p><p>However, long-term use should be monitored due to potential side effects related to its glycyrrhizin content.</p><h2 id="4">4. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale linctuse" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely recognized for its efficacy in alleviating nausea and digestive discomfort.</p><p>Herbal linctuses containing ginger extract are formulated to provide a soothing, easily digestible form of this natural remedy, making them particularly suitable for individuals experiencing motion sickness, morning sickness, or postoperative nausea. These linctuses often combine ginger with other calming ingredients like peppermint or fennel to enhance their soothing effects. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, are believed to work by reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and inhibiting the release of certain chemicals that contribute to nausea.</p><p>As a result, ginger-based linctuses offer a safe and effective alternative for managing nausea, especially when conventional medications are not preferred or tolerated.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Herbal linctuses containing Cinnamomum verum are often prepared with a base of honey or glycerin to enhance their medicinal properties and improve palatability.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using cinnamon-based remedies, especially for prolonged or severe cases of nausea.</p><h2 id="6">6. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita linctuse" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal linctuses to alleviate nausea due to its calming and digestive properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically combine peppermint oil with other soothing ingredients like licorice root or ginger to enhance their effectiveness.

The active compound, piperine, is believed to enhance the absorption of other nutrients and may interact with neurotransmitters that regulate nausea. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using piper nigrum linctuses, as they may interact with certain medications or exacerbate existing conditions.</p><p>While some anecdotal evidence supports its use for nausea relief, more scientific research is needed to fully validate its efficacy and safety.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus linctuse" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms of nausea.</p><p>When formulated into a linctus, or syrup, it is often used to soothe gastrointestinal discomfort and reduce nausea, particularly in cases related to hormonal fluctuations or digestive disorders. The active compounds in vitex, such as flavonoids and iridoids, are believed to influence the pituitary gland and regulate hormones that may contribute to nausea. While some studies suggest its potential efficacy, more clinical research is needed to fully establish its safety and effectiveness for this purpose.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Pimpinella anisum</h2><img alt="pimpinella anisum linctuse" src="/images/preparations/pimpinella-anisum-linctuses.jpg"/><p>Pimpinella anisum, commonly known as anise, is often used in herbal linctuses to alleviate nausea due to its carminative and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>These linctuses typically contain a concentrated form of anise oil, which helps soothe the gastrointestinal tract and reduce the sensation of nausea.
