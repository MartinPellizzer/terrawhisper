<p>Swollen gums is a common oral health issue characterized by inflammation and redness of the gums, often caused by poor oral hygiene, gum disease, or other underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies offer a natural and effective way to treat swollen gums, thanks to their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>Herbs such as aloe vera, chamomile, eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oil are commonly used to reduce swelling and fight infection, while others like turmeric, ginger, and clove oil are valued for their analgesic and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like mouthwashes, toothpaste, and mouth sprays containing these herbs can be made at home or purchased over-the-counter, offering a convenient and non-invasive treatment option for swollen gums.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes swollen gums?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of swollen gums are poor oral hygiene, gum disease (periodontitis), and certain underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and leukemia.</p>
<p>Secondary causes of swollen gums include the use of certain medications like steroids and some antidepressants, as well as hormonal changes during pregnancy or menstruation, which can cause inflammation and irritation in the gums.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing swollen gums include smoking and using tobacco products, as they reduce blood flow and damage gum tissue, and consuming a diet high in sugar and acidic foods, which can contribute to gum disease.</p>
<p>Additionally, people with a family history of gum disease or who engage in infrequent dental check-ups and cleanings are also at a higher risk of developing swollen gums.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal swollen gums?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat swollen gums are Aloe vera, Calendula, and Echinacea, which have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties that help to reduce swelling and combat infection.</p>
<p>Aloe vera contains bioactive compounds such as aloin and aloe-emodin, which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects that soothe and protect the gums.</p>
<p>Calendula has therapeutic actions of reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing, due to its bioactive compounds like triterpenoids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>Echinacea's bioactive compounds like alkylamides and caffeic acid have immunomodulatory effects that help to regulate the immune response and prevent further inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat swollen gums?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat swollen gums are often made into teas, infusions, and poultices to effectively reduce inflammation and promote healing.</p>
<p>A warm tea or infusion can be consumed to help alleviate pain and discomfort, while a cold infusion can be applied topically to bring down swelling.</p>
<p>Poultices made from various plant extracts can be applied directly to the affected area to draw out toxins and reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbal mouthwashes and gargles can be used to kill bacteria and promote the healing of swollen gums.</p>
