Pelargonium graveolens</h2><img alt="pelargonium graveolens tincture" src="/images/preparations/pelargonium-graveolens-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Pelargonium graveolens, commonly known as geranium, is a herb that has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>Herbal tinctures made from Pelargonium graveolens are often used to support the treatment of laryngitis, which is inflammation of the larynx typically caused by viral infections or irritants.

Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tincture" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is often used in herbal tinctures to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms associated with laryngitis.</p><p>While it is more traditionally associated with menstrual health and stress relief, some practitioners suggest it may help reduce inflammation and soothe the throat by modulating hormonal fluctuations that can exacerbate laryngeal irritation. Herbal tinctures containing vitex are typically prepared by soaking the dried berries in alcohol, allowing the active compounds to be extracted for use. These tinctures are often taken in small doses, usually diluted in water or another liquid, to avoid potential side effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using vitex agnus-castus, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.
