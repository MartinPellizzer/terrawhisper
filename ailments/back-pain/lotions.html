Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus lotion" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-lotions.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, also known as chasteberry, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support hormonal balance and alleviate various health conditions.</p><p>While primarily known for its effects on women's health, some studies suggest that vitex may also possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that could potentially help with musculoskeletal discomfort, including back pain. Herbal lotions infused with vitex agnus-castus are often marketed as natural alternatives to conventional pain relief products, offering a gentler approach for those seeking holistic treatments.
