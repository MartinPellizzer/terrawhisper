The aromatic compounds in cinnamon have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects that may soothe irritated nasal passages and reduce sinus pressure. When applied topically, these creams can provide localized relief without systemic side effects, making them a natural alternative for those seeking non-pharmaceutical remedies.</p><p>However, it is important to use these products with caution, as some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions to cinnamon-based formulations.</p><h2 id="7">7.
