One of the key benefits of herbal capsules is their ability to mask the strong or unpleasant taste of certain herbs, making them more palatable for regular use. This taste masking is achieved through the use of encapsulation technology, which encloses the herbal powder or extract within a protective shell.</p><p>As a result, herbal capsules provide a more pleasant experience for individuals who might otherwise avoid herbal remedies due to their strong flavors.</p><div class="toc">
