When incorporated into recipes, they can add a subtle sweetness or a slight bitterness depending on the specific herb used, thus altering the overall flavor profile. Additionally, mucillages can absorb excess moisture, which may intensify certain flavors or reduce the intensity of others in a dish.</p><p>As a result, they are widely used in both traditional and modern cooking to achieve desired taste changes and improve the sensory experience of food.</p><div class="toc">
