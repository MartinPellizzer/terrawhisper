alt="teas for taste changes">
<p>Herbal teas for taste changes are a type of remedy used to alleviate the condition known as dysgeusia, where an individual experiences an abnormal or unpleasant alteration in their sense of taste.</p>
<p>These herbal teas can provide relief and restore balance to the taste buds by addressing underlying issues such as inflammation, infection, or nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Some popular herbal teas used to treat taste changes include peppermint, which helps to reduce inflammation and ease digestive discomfort; ginger, which has anti-inflammatory properties and aids in digestion; licorice root, which soothes the mucous membranes and reduces inflammation; chamomile, which calms the nervous system and promotes relaxation; and lemon balm, which has antiviral properties and helps to reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as echinacea, fennel, and sage are also used to treat taste changes, as they help to boost the immune system, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy digestion.</p>


<div class="study" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
<p>
According to "Journal of the science of food and agriculture", teas for taste changes may be influenced by the synergistic interactions of bioactive compounds such as flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins, and flavonols found in green teas, as well as theaflavins and thearubigins in black tea, l-theanine in white tea, and diverse polyphenols in herbal teas.
