Some individuals may find these creams beneficial for their natural and potentially fewer side effects compared to pharmaceutical options.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy to ensure safety and appropriateness for individual health conditions.</p><div class="toc">
