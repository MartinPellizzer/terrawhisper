Herbal creams containing Cinnamomum verum may help reduce gum inflammation, plaque formation, and gingival bleeding when used as part of a comprehensive periodontal care regimen. These natural remedies offer a promising alternative or adjunct to conventional treatments, particularly for patients seeking holistic dental care options.</p><p>However, further clinical studies are needed to establish their efficacy and long-term safety in managing periodontal conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/curcuma-longa-creams.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been widely studied for its potential benefits in treating periodontal disease due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>The active compound curcumin in turmeric has shown the ability to reduce bacterial growth and inflammation in the gums, which are key factors in the progression of periodontal disease. Herbal creams containing curcuma longa can be applied topically to the affected areas, providing a natural alternative to conventional treatments. These creams may help in reducing plaque, gingivitis, and even reversing early stages of gum recession.</p><p>However, while preliminary research is promising, more clinical studies are needed to fully establish their efficacy and safety in long-term periodontal care.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/echinacea-purpurea-creams.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, has been traditionally used for its immune-boosting properties, and recent studies suggest it may also have potential benefits for oral health.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, echinacea purpurea may help reduce inflammation and bacterial growth in the gums, which are key factors in periodontal disease.
