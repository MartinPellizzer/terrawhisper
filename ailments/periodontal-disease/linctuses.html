While not a substitute for professional dental care, herbal linctuses may aid in reducing gum inflammation and supporting overall oral health when used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. However, their efficacy in treating periodontal disease has not been extensively studied in clinical trials, and their use should be discussed with a healthcare provider.</p><p>Despite their potential benefits, herbal linctuses are generally considered complementary rather than primary treatments for periodontal conditions.</p>
