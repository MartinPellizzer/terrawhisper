These herbal linctuses are particularly effective for conditions like sore throat, laryngitis, and upper respiratory infections where pain and discomfort during swallowing are prominent.</p><p>However, long-term use should be monitored due to potential side effects associated with glycyrrhizin, such as increased blood pressure and fluid retention.</p><h2 id="2">2.
