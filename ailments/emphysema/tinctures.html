While some studies suggest that ginkgo biloba might improve lung function and alleviate symptoms in individuals with chronic respiratory conditions, including emphysema, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. It is often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments, but it should not replace prescribed medical care.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tincture" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits.</p><p>Tinctures made from Urtica dioica are believed to support lung function and may help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic respiratory conditions like emphysema.
