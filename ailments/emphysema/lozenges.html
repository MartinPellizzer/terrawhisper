The active compounds in eucalyptus, including cineole, help to reduce inflammation and clear mucus from the airways. While they may provide some relief, they should not replace prescribed medical treatments for emphysema.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these lozenges, especially for individuals with chronic lung conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator properties, making it a potential natural remedy for managing symptoms of emphysema.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing ginger extract may help reduce inflammation in the airways and ease breathing difficulties associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema. These lozenges are often formulated with other complementary ingredients like honey or eucalyptus to enhance their soothing and expectorant effects. While ginger is generally considered safe, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using it as a supplement, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>Although more research is needed to confirm its efficacy, ginger lozenges may offer a supportive, natural option for symptom relief in emphysema patients.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These lozenges may help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema, by reducing mucus production and improving airway clearance. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using these lozenges, as they are not a substitute for prescribed medical treatments.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more clinical research is needed to fully understand their efficacy in managing emphysema.</p><h2 id="4">4. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits.</p><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra herbal lozenges are formulated to soothe irritated airways and may help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic respiratory conditions like emphysema. The active compounds in licorice root, such as glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, possess anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties that may support lung function. These lozenges are often used as a complementary therapy to conventional treatments for emphysema, though they should not replace prescribed medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita lozenge" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal lozenges to provide relief for respiratory conditions such as emphysema.</p><p>These lozenges work by soothing irritated throat tissues and reducing coughing, which is a common symptom in individuals with emphysema. The menthol in peppermint has a cooling effect that can help ease breathing and promote a sense of clarity in the airways. While not a cure for emphysema, peppermint lozenges may offer symptomatic relief and support overall respiratory comfort.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using herbal remedies, especially for those with chronic lung conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.

While there is limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy for emphysema specifically, some studies suggest that sage may have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that could support overall respiratory health. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage lozenges, as they may interact with other medications or treatments.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, sage lozenges may be considered as part of a broader management plan for emphysema, but they should not replace prescribed medical treatments.</p><h2 id="7">7. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus lozenge" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hormonal balancing properties.</p><p>While primarily used for menstrual and hormonal issues, some alternative practitioners suggest it may support respiratory health. However, there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking Vitex agnus-castus herbal lozenges to the treatment of emphysema.

Rosmarinus officinalis</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/rosmarinus-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, has been traditionally used for its aromatic and therapeutic properties, and rosemary herbal lozenges are now being explored for their potential benefits in managing symptoms associated with emphysema.</p><p>These lozenges contain essential oils and antioxidants derived from rosemary, which may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the respiratory system. While scientific research on rosemary's direct impact on emphysema is limited, some studies suggest that its anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects could support lung function and ease breathing difficulties. As a complementary therapy, rosemary lozenges may offer a natural option to alleviate coughing and throat irritation commonly experienced by emphysema patients.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these lozenges as part of a treatment plan for chronic respiratory conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.

While not a cure for emphysema, thymus vulgaris lozenges may assist in improving breathing by enhancing lung function and reducing bronchial spasms. They are often used as a complementary therapy alongside standard medical treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using these lozenges, as their efficacy and safety can vary, and they may interact with other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.
