However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these tinctures, especially for individuals with kidney conditions or those taking diuretic medications.</p><p>While some people find relief from swollen feet using Equisetum arvense tinctures, they should not be relied upon as a sole treatment without medical guidance.</p><h2 id="7">7. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tincture" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal tinctures to address various health concerns, including swollen feet.</p><p>These tinctures are typically made by soaking lavender flowers in alcohol, allowing the plant's anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties to be extracted.

The herb is believed to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which may help reduce swelling and discomfort in the feet. However, due to the presence of allantoin and pyrrolidine alkaloids, it is important to use comfrey tinctures cautiously, as they may pose risks with prolonged or internal use.</p><p>Despite these precautions, many people find symptomatic relief from applying comfrey tincture topically to the affected areas for swollen feet.</p><h2 id="10">10.
