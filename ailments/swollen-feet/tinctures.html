These tinctures are often prepared by soaking the dried herb in alcohol, allowing the active compounds to be extracted for medicinal use. While some anecdotal evidence suggests that Cnicus benedictus tinctures can support lymphatic drainage and reduce swelling, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using them, especially for chronic or severe cases of swollen feet.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses can vary, and it should be used as a complementary therapy rather than a substitute for medical treatment.</p><h2 id="3">3.
