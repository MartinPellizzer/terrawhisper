<h2 id="1">1. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties, making it a popular choice for addressing swollen feet.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it can help reduce fluid retention and alleviate discomfort associated with edema. The high concentration of minerals like potassium and magnesium in stinging nettle supports kidney function, aiding in the removal of excess fluids from the body. To prepare the juice, fresh nettle leaves are typically juiced and consumed either alone or combined with other herbs like dandelion or parsley for enhanced effects.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle juice, especially for individuals with kidney issues or those on medication.</p><h2 id="2">2. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina juice" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-juices.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, commonly known as rosehip, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support joint health and reduce inflammation.</p><p>The potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of rosehip seeds make it particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing swollen feet, often caused by conditions like arthritis or poor circulation. Rosa canina herbal juices are typically made by cold-pressing the dried fruits of the rose plant, preserving the high levels of vitamin C and essential fatty acids. These juices can help reduce fluid retention and alleviate discomfort associated with swollen feet when consumed regularly as part of a holistic health routine.</p><p>Incorporating rosa canina into a balanced diet, along with proper hydration and movement, may contribute to improved overall foot health and well-being.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compound in milk thistle, silymarin, is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could potentially aid in reducing swelling. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence directly linking milk thistle juice to the reduction of foot swelling.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in reducing inflammation and promoting circulation.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it may help alleviate symptoms of swollen feet by supporting hormonal balance and reducing fluid retention.

Some individuals use vitex herbal juice as a complementary remedy alongside conventional treatments for edema.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Nymphaea alba</h2><img alt="nymphaea alba juice" src="/images/preparations/nymphaea-alba-juices.jpg"/><p>Nymphaea alba, commonly known as the white water lily, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.</p><p>Herbal juices derived from Nymphaea alba are believed to help reduce swelling in the feet by promoting the elimination of excess fluids from the body. The plant contains compounds such as flavonoids and alkaloids that may support circulation and reduce inflammation, making it a natural remedy for swollen feet. When consumed as a juice, it can be combined with other herbs like ginger or dandelion to enhance its detoxifying effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using Nymphaea alba juice, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are on medication.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus juice" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-juices.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in reducing swelling, particularly in the feet.</p><p>The plant contains compounds such as flavonoids and saponins, which may help improve circulation and reduce inflammation. Herbal juices made from Cnicus benedictus are believed to support lymphatic drainage and alleviate fluid retention, making them a popular remedy for swollen feet. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these juices, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><p>While some people report positive results, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy for swollen feet is limited.</p><h2 id="7">7. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense juice" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-juices.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its high silica content, which may support tissue repair and reduce inflammation.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it is believed to help alleviate symptoms of swollen feet by promoting circulation and reducing water retention. The juice is typically made by steeping fresh or dried horsetail in water or a mild alcohol solution, then straining and consuming it in small amounts. Some practitioners recommend combining it with other herbs like nettle or dandelion for enhanced detoxifying and diuretic effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using horsetail juice, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><h2 id="8">8. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium juice" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-juices.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, it may help reduce swelling in the feet by promoting better blood flow and reducing fluid retention. The plant contains compounds such as flavonoids and essential oils that contribute to its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. To prepare the juice, fresh leaves and flowers are typically crushed and extracted with a mild solvent like water or apple cider vinegar.</p><p>While some individuals may find relief from swollen feet using yarrow juice, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment, especially for those with existing health conditions or who are taking medications.</p><h2 id="9">9. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory compound that may help reduce swelling in the feet.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, turmeric can support circulation and decrease inflammation, which is often associated with swollen feet. The bioavailability of curcumin is enhanced when combined with black pepper or healthy fats, making the juice more effective. Regular consumption of turmeric juice may alleviate symptoms of conditions like edema or arthritis that contribute to foot swelling.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using turmeric juice as a treatment, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="10">10. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia juice" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-juices.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal remedies for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When consumed as a juice, it may help reduce swelling in the feet by promoting circulation and easing inflammation. The essential oils in lavender have been shown to have mild diuretic effects, which can aid in reducing fluid retention. However, it is important to note that while some people find relief from lavender-infused juices, they should not replace medical treatment for severe swelling.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before incorporating herbal juices into your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions.</p>
