<h2 id="1">1. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a potent herbal remedy often used in teas to address various health concerns, including swollen feet.</p><p>The tea is made by steeping the dried leaves of the plant in hot water, allowing its active compounds to infuse into the liquid. Stinging nettle tea is believed to help reduce inflammation and improve circulation, which can alleviate the discomfort associated with swollen feet. It is also rich in minerals like potassium and magnesium, which may support fluid balance and reduce water retention.</p><p>While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using stinging nettle tea, especially for those with existing health conditions or who are taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a popular herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support overall health, including the reduction of swelling in the feet.</p><p>The tea is made from the dried fruits of the rose plant and is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and essential nutrients such as vitamin C and polyphenols. These compounds are believed to help reduce inflammation and improve circulation, which can be beneficial for individuals experiencing swollen feet due to conditions like edema or poor circulation. Drinking Rosa canina tea regularly may help alleviate discomfort and promote fluid balance in the body.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating this herbal tea into a treatment plan, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support liver function and promote detoxification, which may indirectly help reduce swelling in the feet.</p><p>Its active compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids, are believed to have anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties that can aid in reducing fluid retention. When brewed into a tea, blessed thistle may help alleviate mild edema by supporting the body's natural processes of eliminating excess fluids. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using this herb, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>While blessed thistle tea can be a complementary approach for swollen feet, it should not replace medical treatment for underlying causes of edema.</p><h2 id="4">4. Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/hypericum-perforatum-teas.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is traditionally used in herbal teas to support overall wellness, though its primary benefits are often associated with mood support rather than directly treating swollen feet.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking St. John's Wort to the reduction of foot swelling, some proponents suggest that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may contribute to reducing inflammation and improving circulation. When consumed as a tea, St. John's Wort may help alleviate mild swelling by promoting better blood flow and reducing oxidative stress in the body. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>For persistent or severe foot swelling, it is advisable to seek professional medical advice to address underlying causes such as fluid retention or circulatory issues.</p><h2 id="5">5. Nymphaea alba</h2><img alt="nymphaea alba tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/nymphaea-alba-teas.jpg"/><p>Nymphaea alba, commonly known as white water lily, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, it may help alleviate symptoms of swollen feet by promoting circulation and reducing inflammation. The tea is believed to support the body's natural detoxification processes, which can ease fluid retention. It is often combined with other herbs like ginger or chamomile to enhance its soothing effects.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Nymphaea alba tea, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are pregnant.</p><h2 id="6">6. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/silybum-marianum-teas.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support liver health and may offer benefits for individuals experiencing swollen feet.</p><p>The active compound, silymarin, is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that could help reduce fluid retention and inflammation in the lower extremities. While scientific evidence on its effectiveness for swollen feet is limited, some users report relief from edema when consuming milk thistle tea regularly. It is often recommended as a complementary therapy alongside other treatments for circulatory issues or hormonal imbalances that contribute to foot swelling.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/equisetum-arvense-teas.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its diuretic properties, which can help reduce swelling in the feet.</p><p>The plant contains high levels of silica and other minerals that may support the body's natural detoxification processes and improve circulation. When brewed into a tea, equisetum arvense can act as a mild diuretic, helping to reduce fluid retention and alleviate puffiness in the feet. However, it is important to use this herb in moderation and consult with a healthcare provider, as it may interact with certain medications or cause dehydration if not consumed properly.</p><p>Despite its potential benefits, equisetum arvense should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment for persistent swelling.</p><h2 id="8">8. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/vitex-agnus-castus-teas.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance and alleviate various health conditions.</p><p>While it is not a direct remedy for swollen feet, its potential to reduce fluid retention and improve circulation may offer some relief for individuals experiencing mild edema. The herb contains compounds like flavonoids and essential oils that may help in reducing inflammation and promoting lymphatic drainage. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using Vitex agnus-castus, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>When consumed as a tea, Vitex agnus-castus may complement a holistic approach to managing swollen feet, though it should not replace medical treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9. Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/lavandula-angustifolia-teas.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often used in herbal teas to help alleviate symptoms of swollen feet due to its anti-inflammatory and calming properties.</p><p>The essential oils in lavender, such as linalool and lavandulol, have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve circulation, which can aid in reducing fluid retention. When brewed into a calming herbal tea, lavender can soothe the body and promote relaxation, which may indirectly help with swelling by reducing stress-related fluid retention. It is typically consumed warm, either on its own or combined with other herbs like chamomile or ginger for enhanced benefits.</p><p>While lavender tea is generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it for persistent or severe swelling, as it may indicate an underlying medical condition.</p><h2 id="10">10. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/achillea-millefolium-teas.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it can help alleviate symptoms of swollen feet by promoting better blood flow and reducing inflammation. The herb contains compounds like sesquiterpenes and flavonoids, which are believed to support lymphatic drainage and reduce fluid retention. To prepare the tea, steep 1-2 teaspoons of dried yarrow in hot water for 10-15 minutes, and drink it twice daily.</p><p>While generally safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using yarrow, especially for those with bleeding disorders or on blood-thinning medications.</p>
