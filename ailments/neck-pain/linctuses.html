Many herbal linctuses contain ingredients that are more effective for respiratory conditions rather than musculoskeletal issues. For neck pain, it is generally advised to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatments such as physical therapy, heat therapy, or targeted medications.</p><p>Therefore, relying on herbal linctuses for neck pain is not a reliable or evidence-based approach.</p><div class="toc">
