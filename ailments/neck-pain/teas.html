Herbal teas made from vitex agnus-castus are often consumed for their calming effects, which can indirectly contribute to reduced stress-related muscle stiffness. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using vitex agnus-castus, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, vitex agnus-castus herbal tea may offer some relief for neck pain when used alongside conventional treatments.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Drinking herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis may also promote relaxation and reduce muscle tension in the neck area, contributing to overall pain relief.
