Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential natural remedy for knee swelling.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal juice, sage can help reduce inflammation and pain by containing compounds such as rosmarinic acid and flavonoids, which have been shown to inhibit inflammatory pathways. To prepare the juice, fresh sage leaves are typically crushed and blended with water or a mild vegetable juice to enhance absorption.
