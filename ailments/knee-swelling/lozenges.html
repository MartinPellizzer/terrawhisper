While herbal lozenges are generally safe, they may not directly target knee swelling, as they are primarily designed for throat and mouth conditions. Therefore, they should be used as a complementary therapy alongside other treatments recommended by a healthcare professional.</p><p>It is important to consult a doctor before using herbal lozenges, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><div class="toc">
