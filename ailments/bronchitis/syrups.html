Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum syrup" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal syrups to support respiratory health, particularly in the treatment of bronchitis.</p><p>The essential oils and bioactive compounds in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde and eugenol, possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may help reduce bronchial irritation and fight respiratory infections.
