Hops (Humulus lupulus)</h2><img alt="humulus lupulus cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/humulus-lupulus-creams.jpg"/><p>Humulus lupulus, commonly known as hops, is often used in herbal creams to address sleep deprivation due to its calming and sedative properties.</p><p>These creams typically contain extracts of hop cones, which are rich in compounds like alpha acids and flavonoids that may promote relaxation and reduce anxiety.

While some traditional medicine practices use diluted forms of nux-vomica in formulations like herbal creams to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, its use remains controversial due to the risk of poisoning. Despite these concerns, some individuals and practitioners continue to use these creams under strict supervision, believing they may help alleviate symptoms of insomnia.</p><p>However, scientific evidence supporting its efficacy and safety for sleep disorders is limited, and it is generally advised to seek conventional medical treatments for chronic sleep deprivation.</p><h2 id="7">7.

However, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for improving sleep quality.</p><p>As a result, echinacea purpurea herbal creams are sometimes used as complementary treatments to support better sleep, though they should not replace conventional medical advice.</p><h2 id="8">8.
