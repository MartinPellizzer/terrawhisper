These creams are applied to the skin, often on the wrists, temples, or feet, to allow the active compounds to be absorbed through the skin and affect the nervous system. While they may offer some soothing effects, their efficacy can vary, and they are generally considered complementary to other sleep aids rather than a standalone solution.</p><p>As with any supplement or topical treatment, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><div class="toc">
