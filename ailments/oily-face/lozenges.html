For individuals with oily skin, it is important to use products that are specifically formulated for oily skin types, such as non-comedogenic moisturizers and cleansers. Herbal lozenges should not be used as a substitute for proper skincare routines tailored to oily skin.</p><p>If you are looking for skincare products that can help manage oily skin, it is best to consult a dermatologist or choose skincare items with proven benefits for oily skin types.</p>
