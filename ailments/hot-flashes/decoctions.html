Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus decoction" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to support hormonal balance, particularly in women experiencing menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from vitex berries are often prepared by simmering the dried fruit in water for several minutes, then allowing it to steep before consumption. Studies suggest that vitex may influence the pituitary gland's production of luteinizing hormone, which can indirectly affect estrogen levels and help alleviate menopausal symptoms. While some clinical trials have shown promising results, more rigorous research is needed to confirm its efficacy and standardize dosages.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, vitex agnus-castus is generally considered safe for short-term use, though it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal decoctions made from maca root are often prepared by simmering the dried root in water for several hours to extract its active compounds. These decoctions are believed to support overall vitality and mood, in addition to their thermoregulatory effects.</p><p>While more clinical studies are needed, preliminary evidence indicates that maca may be a natural and complementary option for managing menopausal symptoms.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Herbal decoctions made from Equisetum arvense are typically prepared by simmering the dried herb in water for an extended period to extract its beneficial properties. While some studies suggest that horsetail may help regulate body temperature and reduce the frequency of hot flashes, more rigorous clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using Equisetum arvense, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6.
