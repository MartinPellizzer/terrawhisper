Soaking in the bath allows these beneficial compounds to be absorbed through the skin, potentially easing discomfort and promoting relaxation. However, it's important to note that herbal baths should not replace professional dental care, especially for severe or persistent tooth pain.</p><p>This natural approach can be a calming and supportive addition to a holistic treatment plan for mild toothaches.</p><div class="toc">
