They can be applied directly to the affected area to provide localized relief without the need for systemic medications. While they may not cure the underlying cause of a toothache, they can offer temporary comfort and support during the healing process.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a dentist if the pain persists, as herbal creams are not a substitute for professional dental care.</p>
