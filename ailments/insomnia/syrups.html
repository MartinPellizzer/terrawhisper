However, due to its potent and potentially dangerous properties, the use of such syrups is highly regulated and should only be administered under strict medical supervision. Modern herbal practitioners often avoid it for insomnia due to safety concerns, preferring safer alternatives with proven efficacy.</p><p>Despite its controversial nature, some traditional formulations may still be found in certain regions, emphasizing the need for caution and professional guidance when considering its use.</p><h2 id="6">6.

Herbal syrups containing echinacea are often used as natural remedies to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, though they are not a substitute for conventional sleep aids. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using echinacea syrups, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, more scientific research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for treating insomnia.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Triticum aestivum</h2><img alt="triticum aestivum syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/triticum-aestivum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Triticum aestivum, commonly known as common wheat, is not typically used as a herbal syrup for insomnia, but certain traditional formulations may incorporate wheat-based ingredients for their calming properties.</p><p>While wheat itself is not a primary herb for sleep disorders, some herbal syrups may blend it with other sedative herbs like valerian root or chamomile to promote relaxation and better sleep. These syrups are often marketed as natural remedies to help alleviate mild insomnia by reducing anxiety and nervous tension. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of such syrups can vary, and they should not replace professional medical advice for chronic sleep issues.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with allergies or existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9.
