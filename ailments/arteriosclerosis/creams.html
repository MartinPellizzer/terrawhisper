According to "Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)", Ruscus aculeatus creams for arteriosclerosis, specifically for treating chronic orthostatic hypotension (OH), have been shown to possess vasoconstrictive and venotonic properties, which can help alleviate the symptoms of OH, such as the pooling of blood in the limbs, and improve the quality of life for those affected.
