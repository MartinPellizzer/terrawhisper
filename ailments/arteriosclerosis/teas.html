Some studies suggest that regular consumption of herbal teas rich in polyphenols can improve blood lipid profiles and enhance endothelial function, which are critical in preventing the progression of arteriosclerosis. However, while herbal teas may offer complementary benefits, they should not replace medical treatments prescribed by healthcare professionals.</p><p>It is important to consult with a physician before incorporating herbal teas into a treatment plan, especially for individuals with existing cardiovascular conditions.</p>
