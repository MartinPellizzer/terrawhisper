Some herbal juices also contain compounds that can help lower cholesterol levels and improve blood circulation, which are critical factors in preventing the progression of arteriosclerosis. While these juices are not a substitute for medical treatment, they may complement conventional therapies when used under professional guidance.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence supporting their efficacy for arteriosclerosis is still limited, and individual responses to herbal supplements can vary.</p><div class="toc">
