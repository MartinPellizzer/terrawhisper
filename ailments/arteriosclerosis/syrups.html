While some studies suggest that herbal syrups may help improve blood flow and reduce arterial plaque, more research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety in treating arteriosclerosis. These syrups are often considered complementary to conventional treatments, rather than a replacement, and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Overall, herbal syrups offer a holistic approach to managing arteriosclerosis, though their role in long-term prevention and treatment remains an area of ongoing scientific exploration.</p>
