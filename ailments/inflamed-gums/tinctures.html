<h2 id="1">1. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making it a valuable ingredient in herbal tinctures for inflamed gums.</p><p>These tinctures typically combine sage with alcohol to extract its active compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, which help reduce gum inflammation and bacterial growth. When applied topically or used in mouth rinses, sage tinctures can soothe irritated gums and promote healing by decreasing swelling and redness. They are often recommended as a natural alternative to conventional mouthwashes, especially for individuals seeking holistic oral care solutions.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using sage tinctures, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/calendula-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis herbal tinctures are traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, making them a popular natural remedy for inflamed gums.</p><p>The active compounds in calendula, such as flavonoids and triterpenes, help reduce swelling and irritation while promoting tissue repair.

The active compounds in bloodroot, such as sanguinarine, have demonstrated antimicrobial and analgesic effects, making it a potential natural remedy for gum irritation. However, due to its potency and potential for toxicity, it should be used with caution and under the guidance of a qualified herbalist or healthcare professional.</p><p>While some studies suggest its efficacy in treating oral infections, more research is needed to fully understand its safety and effectiveness for long-term use.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea tincture" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal tinctures are commonly used to support gum health due to their anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p><p>These tinctures contain compounds like alkamides, caffeic acid derivatives, and polysaccharides that help reduce inflammation and combat bacterial infections in the gums.

Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tincture" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties, making it a valuable ingredient in herbal tinctures for inflamed gums.</p><p>When prepared as a tincture, Urtica dioica can be applied topically to reduce swelling, redness, and discomfort associated with gum inflammation.
