<p>Ginkgo biloba teas have been traditionally used to help alleviate symptoms of depression due to their adaptogenic properties, which enable the body to adapt to stress and promote balance in the nervous system.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents present in ginkgo biloba, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, have been found to have a positive effect on the neurotransmitters responsible for regulating mood, including serotonin and dopamine.</p>
