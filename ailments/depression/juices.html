Some studies suggest that St. John's Wort may help alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression by increasing serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels. However, it is important to note that herbal juices containing St. John's Wort can interact with various medications and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Despite its historical use and some scientific backing, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety for treating depression.</p><h2 id="2">2.
