While more clinical research is needed, some preliminary evidence indicates that licorice root capsules could be a complementary therapy for individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. It is important to note that licorice root should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it may interact with certain medications and is not a substitute for conventional treatments.</p><p>Overall, glycyrrhiza glabra herbal capsules show promise as a natural supplement for supporting mental well-being, though further investigation is necessary to confirm their efficacy and safety.</p><h2 id="5">5.

These capsules are typically standardized to contain a specific concentration of active compounds, such as aucubin and flavonoids, which are believed to influence neurotransmitter activity and mood regulation. While research on its direct effects on depression is limited, some studies suggest that Vitex may help alleviate depressive symptoms by modulating serotonin levels and improving overall emotional well-being.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Black cumin (Nigella sativa)</h2><img alt="nigella sativa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/nigella-sativa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Nigella sativa, commonly known as black cumin, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits, including its possible role in alleviating symptoms of depression.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the active compound thymoquinone in nigella sativa may help regulate neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are crucial for mood regulation. Herbal capsules containing nigella sativa are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for depression. While more research is needed, some individuals report improved mood and reduced depressive symptoms after incorporating nigella sativa into their wellness routine.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before use, especially for those undergoing treatment for mental health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7.

Herbal capsules containing echinacea purpurea are often marketed as natural supplements that support emotional balance and mood regulation. These capsules are typically made from the dried roots and flowers of the plant and are available in various formulations.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea for depression, as it may interact with other medications and is not a guaranteed treatment for clinical depression.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cherry bomb (Melia azedarach)</h2><img alt="melia azedarach capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/melia-azedarach-capsules.jpg"/><p>Melia azedarach herbal capsules are derived from the seeds of the Melia azedarach tree, commonly known as the chinaberry tree, and have been traditionally used in some cultures for their potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>These capsules are often marketed as natural remedies for depression, claiming to help alleviate symptoms through their purported anti-depressant and mood-enhancing effects. While some preliminary studies suggest that compounds in Melia azedarach may influence neurotransmitter activity, more rigorous clinical research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for treating depression. Due to potential toxicity and lack of standardized dosing, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using these capsules as a treatment for mental health conditions.</p><p>Overall, while Melia azedarach may hold promise, it should not replace conventional depression treatments without proper medical guidance.</p><h2 id="9">9.
