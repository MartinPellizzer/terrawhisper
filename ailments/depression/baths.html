The warm water of the bath can also promote relaxation and reduce stress, enhancing the overall therapeutic effect of the herbal treatment. Some individuals find that regular use of St. John's Wort baths can contribute to a sense of calm and emotional balance.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using this method, especially if taking other medications, due to potential interactions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis bath" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-baths.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and improve sleep.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal baths, valerian's sedative properties can help alleviate symptoms of depression by reducing anxiety and promoting a sense of calm.
