These compounds are believed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that may aid in reducing pain and inflammation after surgery. Some studies suggest that St. John's wort may also support emotional well-being by influencing neurotransmitter levels, which can be beneficial during the recovery period.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using Hypericum perforatum, as it may interact with certain medications and affect surgical outcomes.</p><h2 id="5">5. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale decoction" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from fresh or dried ginger root are often prepared by simmering the rhizome in water, allowing the active compounds such as gingerol and shogaol to be extracted. These decoctions may support postoperative recovery by reducing nausea, inflammation, and pain, which are common complications after surgery. Some studies suggest that ginger can enhance gastrointestinal motility and reduce the risk of postoperative ileus.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using ginger decoctions, especially in patients taking medications or with underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis decoction" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from sage leaves are believed to support postoperative recovery by promoting wound healing and reducing inflammation. These decoctions may also aid in reducing excessive sweating and improving oral health, which are common concerns after surgery. The antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds in sage contribute to its effectiveness in supporting the bodyâ€™s healing processes.</p><p>While more research is needed, preliminary studies suggest that sage-based decoctions could be a complementary therapy in postoperative care.</p><h2 id="7">7. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea decoction" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, has been traditionally used for its immunostimulant properties and is increasingly being explored for its potential role in postoperative recovery.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from Echinacea purpurea may help reduce inflammation and support the immune system, which can be beneficial during the healing process after surgery. Some studies suggest that these decoctions might shorten recovery time by promoting tissue repair and reducing the risk of postoperative infections. However, more clinical research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in this context.</p><p>As a complementary therapy, Echinacea purpurea decoctions should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure they do not interfere with standard postoperative care or medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum decoction" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy commonly used in traditional medicine for its potential liver-protective properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from its seeds are believed to support postoperative recovery by promoting liver function and reducing inflammation. These decoctions may aid in detoxification processes, which are crucial for the body's healing after surgery. Some studies suggest that silymarin, the active compound in silybum marianum, may help in tissue repair and reduce oxidative stress.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using these decoctions to ensure they are safe and appropriate for individual health conditions.</p><h2 id="9">9. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra decoction" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from Glycyrrhiza glabra are often employed to support postoperative recovery due to their potential to reduce inflammation and enhance immune function. These decoctions may help alleviate symptoms such as swelling and pain following surgery, promoting faster healing. However, prolonged use of licorice can lead to side effects like hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, so it should be used under medical supervision.</p><p>Overall, Glycyrrhiza glabra decoctions may serve as a complementary therapy in postoperative care when used appropriately.</p><h2 id="10">10. Achillea millefolium</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium decoction" src="/images/preparations/achillea-millefolium-decoctions.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p><p>Herbal decoctions made from dried yarrow leaves and flowers are often prepared by simmering them in water for several minutes to extract their active compounds. These decoctions may support postoperative recovery by reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and aiding in the management of mild bleeding or swelling.
