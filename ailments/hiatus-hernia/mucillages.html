By forming a protective barrier, they may alleviate symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation in individuals with this condition. However, while they are generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating them into a treatment regimen.</p><p>Herbal mucillages can be a complementary approach to managing hiatus hernia, but they should not replace medical advice or prescribed treatments.</p>
