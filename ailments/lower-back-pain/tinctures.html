While some preliminary research supports its use for musculoskeletal conditions, more clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy for lower back pain specifically.</p><p>Nonetheless, echinacea purpurea tinctures are often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments for chronic lower back pain.</p><h2 id="10">10. Thuja occidentalis</h2><img alt="thuja occidentalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/thuja-occidentalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Thuja occidentalis, also known as eastern arborvitae, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries in various medicinal systems.</p><p>Its tincture form is commonly prepared using alcohol as a solvent to extract the active compounds, which include essential oils and phytochemicals believed to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
