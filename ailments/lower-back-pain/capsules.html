These capsules are typically made from the dried aerial parts of the plant and may be combined with other herbs to enhance their effectiveness. While some studies suggest that silica from horsetail may have anti-inflammatory properties, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for chronic lower back pain.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal capsules containing salvia officinalis are often marketed as a natural alternative to conventional pain relievers, offering a gentler approach for individuals seeking complementary therapy. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these capsules, as their efficacy and safety can vary.</p><p>Despite anecdotal support, more rigorous clinical research is needed to fully establish the role of salvia officinalis in the management of lower back pain.</p><h2 id="4">4. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, also known as blessed thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it may offer a natural alternative for managing lower back pain by reducing inflammation and muscle tension in the affected area.

Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)</h2><img alt="achillea millefolium capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/achillea-millefolium-capsules.jpg"/><p>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is not a primary treatment for lower back pain, some studies suggest that its bioactive compounds may help reduce inflammation and muscle spasms, which can alleviate discomfort associated with certain types of back pain.

It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow capsules, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, the effectiveness and safety of Achillea millefolium may vary among individuals.</p><h2 id="7">7. Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/curcuma-longa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been widely studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, making it a popular natural remedy for lower back pain.</p><p>The active compound in turmeric, curcumin, is believed to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are often associated with chronic pain conditions. Herbal capsules containing standardized curcumin extracts offer a convenient and concentrated form of this spice, allowing for consistent dosing.

St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a herbal supplement often used for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p><p>While it is more widely recognized for its use in treating mild to moderate depression, some studies suggest it may also provide relief for lower back pain due to its ability to reduce inflammation and nerve sensitivity. Herbal capsules of Hypericum perforatum are typically standardized to contain a specific concentration of active compounds, such as hypericin and hyperforin, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting its efficacy for lower back pain is limited, and more research is needed to confirm its benefits in this context.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, especially since it can interact with other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.

While there is limited clinical evidence specifically linking silybum marianum to relief of lower back pain, it is sometimes used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using this herb, as it may interact with certain medications or have side effects in some individuals.</p><p>Overall, silybum marianum herbal capsules may offer some supportive benefits for lower back pain, but more research is needed to confirm their efficacy.</p>
