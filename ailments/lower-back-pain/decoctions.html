To prepare a decoction, the herbs are typically simmered in water for an extended period to extract their active compounds. These herbal remedies are often preferred for their minimal side effects compared to pharmaceutical drugs, though they should be used under the guidance of a qualified practitioner.</p><p>While herbal decoctions can provide relief for mild to moderate lower back pain, they may not be sufficient for severe or chronic conditions requiring more comprehensive treatment.</p><div class="toc">

Herbal decoctions of achillea millefolium are typically prepared by simmering the dried leaves and flowers in water for several minutes, allowing the active compounds to infuse into the liquid. These decoctions may be consumed as a tea or applied topically as a compress to target localized pain and discomfort.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using achillea millefolium, as it may interact with certain medications and is not a substitute for conventional medical treatment.</p><h2 id="9">9.
