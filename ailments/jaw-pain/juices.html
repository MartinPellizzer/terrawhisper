Some studies suggest that consuming ginger juice can help alleviate symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder and other forms of jaw pain by reducing muscle tension and inflammation. While more research is needed to confirm its efficacy, many people report relief from jaw pain after regular consumption of ginger juice.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using ginger juice, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
