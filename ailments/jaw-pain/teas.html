These teas are typically made by steeping dried echinacea flowers in hot water, and they can be consumed alone or combined with other herbs like ginger or willow bark for enhanced effects.

Rosmarinus officinalis</h2><img alt="rosmarinus officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosmarinus-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosmarinus officinalis, commonly known as rosemary, is a versatile herb often used in herbal teas to support overall health.</p><p>Rosemary tea has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which may help alleviate jaw pain by reducing inflammation and muscle tension in the area.
