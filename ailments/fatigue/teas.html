<p>Herbal teas for fatigue are a type of herbal remedy that involves consuming tea made from various plant extracts to alleviate the symptoms of fatigue, which is a state of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>These teas offer a natural and non-invasive approach to addressing fatigue, providing several benefits such as improved energy levels, reduced stress and anxiety, and enhanced overall well-being.</p>
<p>Some examples of herbal teas used to treat fatigue include peppermint tea, which helps to boost energy and alertness due to its invigorating scent, ginseng tea, which is believed to improve physical and mental stamina, and ashwagandha tea, which is known for its adaptogenic properties that help the body to cope with stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, other herbal teas such as ginger tea, licorice root tea, and yerba mate tea are also used to treat fatigue due to their warming and stimulating effects, as well as their ability to improve circulation and boost the immune system.</p>

<p>
According to "Journal of the American Nutrition Association", teas for fatigue contain polyphenolic compounds, such as catechins and epicatechins, as well as L-theanine, which may help alleviate fatigue due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects.
