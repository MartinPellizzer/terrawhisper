These creams often combine sage extract with other natural ingredients like beeswax or shea butter to enhance their hydrating and protective qualities. The anti-inflammatory and astringent properties of sage may help reduce excess saliva production while simultaneously soothing irritated tissues.</p><p>Although generally safe for topical use, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating sage-based products into a skincare or oral care routine, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or known allergies.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus)</h2><img alt="eucalyptus globulus cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/eucalyptus-globulus-creams.jpg"/><p>Eucalyptus globulus, commonly known as eucalyptus oil, is often used in herbal creams to provide relief for dry mouth due to its soothing and moisturizing properties.</p><p>These creams typically contain a blend of eucalyptus oil along with other natural ingredients like beeswax, shea butter, or glycerin, which help to hydrate and protect the oral mucosa.
