These syrups can help reduce excessive salivation and soothe oral discomfort by promoting a more balanced moisture level in the mouth. Sage syrup is typically used as a complementary therapy alongside other treatments for dry mouth, such as increased fluid intake or saliva stimulants.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using sage syrup, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.
