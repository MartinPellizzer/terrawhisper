The active compounds, such as piperine, are believed to enhance the body's natural secretions, including saliva, by interacting with sensory receptors in the mouth. While some anecdotal evidence suggests that piper nigrum essential oils can alleviate dryness, further scientific research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for this specific use.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using piper nigrum essential oils, especially for prolonged or chronic dry mouth conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.
