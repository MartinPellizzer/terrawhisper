<p>Herbal teas for Hyperthyroidism are a natural and non-invasive approach to treating an overactive thyroid gland, characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>These teas are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that help to regulate thyroid function, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms such as weight loss, anxiety, and rapid heartbeat.</p>
<p>Certain herbal teas, such as Ashwagandha, Bladderwrack, and Licorice root, have been found to have a positive effect on hyperthyroidism, as they contain compounds that help to slow down thyroid hormone production and promote a healthy balance.</p>
<p>Other beneficial herbal teas for hyperthyroidism include Peppermint, Chamomile, and Dandelion root, which aid in digestion, reduce stress, and promote detoxification, ultimately contributing to a more balanced thyroid function.</p>

<p>
According to "International journal of biological macromolecules", teas for hyperthyroidism may be beneficial as a potential alternative treatment, as polyherbal extracts from certain medicinal plants have been shown to restore thyroid function to normal and reduce the increase of liver enzymes caused by hyperthyroidism.
