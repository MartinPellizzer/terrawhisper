While primarily designed for oral use, some formulations are applied topically to target specific areas of hyperpigmentation. They are often preferred by individuals seeking gentle, non-invasive alternatives to chemical treatments.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a dermatologist to ensure they are suitable for one's skin type and condition.</p><div class="toc">
