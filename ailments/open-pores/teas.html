<h2 id="1">1. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green, black, and white teas are derived, is often used in herbal teas for its potential benefits in managing open pores.</p><p>These teas are rich in antioxidants and polyphenols, which can help reduce inflammation and excess sebum production, both of which contribute to the appearance of open pores. Regular consumption of Camellia sinensis-based herbal teas may support skin health by promoting a clearer and more balanced complexion. While topical application of these teas can also be beneficial, their internal consumption may enhance overall skin vitality.</p><p>However, individual results may vary, and it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating these teas into a skincare routine.</p><h2 id="2">2. Matricaria chamomilla</h2><img alt="matricaria chamomilla tea" src="/images/preparations/matricaria-chamomilla-teas.jpg"/><p>Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile, is a popular herbal tea renowned for its calming properties and potential benefits for the skin.</p><p>Chamomile tea is often used topically to soothe irritated skin and reduce redness, making it a favored remedy for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin. When used as a facial toner, chamomile can help tighten pores and promote a clearer complexion by reducing excess oil and inflammation. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may also help in minimizing the appearance of open pores over time.</p><p>However, it is important to patch test before using chamomile on the face, as some individuals may experience allergic reactions or skin irritation.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The active compounds in St. John's Wort, such as hypericin and hyperforin, can be too strong for sensitive skin and may lead to increased redness or sensitivity. As a result, it is generally advised to avoid using St. John's Wort tea directly on the skin, especially on areas with open pores.</p><p>Instead, it is best consumed internally under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure safe and effective use.</p><h2 id="4">4. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a popular herbal tea known for its high concentration of vitamins, particularly vitamin C, which supports skin health.</p><p>This tea is often used in skincare routines to help reduce the appearance of open pores due to its astringent and antioxidant properties. The tannins in rosehip tea can help tighten the skin and improve its overall texture, making it a natural remedy for those concerned with pore visibility. Regular consumption of rosa canina tea may also promote a more even skin tone and enhance the skin's ability to retain moisture.</p><p>As a gentle and nourishing herbal option, rosa canina tea offers a holistic approach to addressing skin concerns related to open pores.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The tea is rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that may help in balancing skin pH and reducing excess sebum production. It is believed that the anti-inflammatory properties of stinging nettle can soothe the skin and promote a more even texture.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing skin conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thorn or St. Benedict's thorn, is a flowering plant traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential benefits in skin care.</p><p>Herbal teas made from Cnicus benedictus are believed to help in the treatment of open pores due to their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant contains compounds that may help tighten the skin and reduce the appearance of pores, making it a popular ingredient in natural skincare formulations.

Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/salvia-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, is a herbal plant widely used in the preparation of herbal teas that are believed to offer various health benefits.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, sage is often associated with its potential to help reduce the appearance of open pores due to its astringent properties. The compounds in sage, such as thujone and flavonoids, may help tighten the skin and improve its overall texture.

Equisetum arvense</h2><img alt="equisetum arvense tea" src="/images/preparations/equisetum-arvense-teas.jpg"/><p>Equisetum arvense, commonly known as field horsetail, is a traditional herbal plant that has been used for centuries in herbal medicine due to its high concentration of silica, which is believed to support skin health.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal tea, equisetum arvense is often used to address concerns related to open pores, as its astringent properties may help tighten and firm the skin’s surface. The tea is typically made by steeping the dried stems of the plant in hot water, and it is often combined with other herbs like green tea or chamomile for enhanced benefits. While some proponents claim that regular consumption of equisetum arvense tea can improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of open pores, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, as it may interact with certain medications.</p><p>Overall, equisetum arvense herbal tea is considered a natural remedy that may support skin health, though its effectiveness for open pores can vary among individuals.</p><h2 id="10">10. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas to support skin health and potentially help with open pores.</p><p>These teas are often praised for their soothing and moisturizing properties, which can help balance the skin's natural oils. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in aloe vera may reduce redness and irritation, promoting a clearer complexion. Regular consumption of aloe-based herbal teas is believed to improve overall skin texture and reduce the appearance of enlarged pores.</p><p>However, while some people report benefits, scientific evidence on its direct impact on pore size remains limited, and it is best used as part of a holistic skincare routine.</p>
