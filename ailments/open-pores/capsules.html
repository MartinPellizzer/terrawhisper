<h2 id="1">1. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/aloe-barbadensis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a popular herbal remedy often used in the form of capsules to support skin health.</p><p>These capsules are typically made from the gel extracted from the inner leaf of the aloe plant, which is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Aloe vera capsules are frequently recommended for individuals with open pores due to their potential to soothe and hydrate the skin while regulating oil production. The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of aloe may help reduce redness and prevent breakouts that can contribute to the appearance of open pores.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying skin conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Centella (Centella asiatica)</h2><img alt="centella asiatica capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/centella-asiatica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Centella asiatica herbal capsules are a natural remedy derived from the Centella asiatica plant, commonly known as gotu kola, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its skin-renewing properties.</p><p>These capsules are formulated to support skin health by promoting collagen production and enhancing skin elasticity, which can help reduce the appearance of open pores. The active compounds in Centella asiatica, such as asiatic acid and madecassol, are known for their ability to strengthen the skin's barrier function and improve overall skin texture. Regular use of these herbal capsules may lead to a more even skin tone and a smoother, more refined complexion.</p><p>They are often recommended as a complementary treatment for those seeking natural solutions to skin concerns like enlarged pores and uneven texture.</p><h2 id="3">3. Thistle (Silybum marianum)</h2><img alt="silybum marianum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/silybum-marianum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential liver-protecting properties.</p><p>While it is primarily known for supporting liver health, some people may use silybum marianum herbal capsules in the context of skincare, particularly for addressing open pores. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking milk thistle to the reduction of open pores or improved skin texture. The active compound in milk thistle, silymarin, is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that could theoretically benefit the skin.</p><p>It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these capsules for skin concerns, as their effectiveness for open pores has not been widely studied or proven.</p><h2 id="4">4. St. john's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/hypericum-perforatum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential benefits in skin health.</p><p>While primarily recognized for its effects on mood and anxiety, some studies suggest that it may also have properties that support skin care, including the potential to help with open pores. The active compounds in Hypericum perforatum, such as flavonoids and hyperforin, may help in reducing inflammation and promoting skin renewal, which can contribute to a more even skin texture. Herbal capsules containing Hypericum perforatum are often used as part of a holistic skincare routine to address concerns related to skin clarity and pore appearance.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating this supplement into your skincare regimen, especially if you are taking other medications or have existing skin conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus)</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cnicus-benedictus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus herbal capsules are formulated to address the issue of open pores by promoting skin renewal and enhancing the skin's natural barrier function.</p><p>This herb is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which help in reducing excess sebum production and preventing pore enlargement. The capsules are typically made from organic and sustainably sourced Cnicus benedictus extracts, ensuring purity and potency. Regular use of these capsules may lead to a more refined and smoother skin texture, making them a popular choice in natural skincare regimens.</p><p>They are often recommended as a complementary treatment to topical skincare products for those seeking holistic approaches to skin health.</p><h2 id="6">6. German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita)</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/chamomilla-recutita-capsules.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita herbal capsules are a natural remedy derived from the flowers of the chamomile plant, known for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These capsules are often used in skincare to help address issues related to open pores, as they contain compounds that may help regulate sebum production and reduce skin irritation. The active components, such as bisabolol and flavonoids, are believed to support skin clarity and improve the appearance of pores by promoting a balanced complexion. When used as part of a daily skincare routine, chamomilla recutita capsules can offer gentle yet effective care for sensitive or acne-prone skin.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating these supplements into your regimen, especially if you have known allergies or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal capsules are commonly used for their potential immune-boosting properties, though they are not specifically formulated for open pores.</p><p>While some topical formulations of echinacea may be used to support skin health, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking echinacea to the reduction of open pores. Open pores are often related to factors such as excess sebum production, aging, or improper skincare routines, rather than a direct effect of echinacea. As a dietary supplement, echinacea is generally considered safe for most people when taken in recommended doses.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chaste tree berry, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential hormonal balancing properties.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it may support skin health by regulating sebum production, which can help reduce the appearance of open pores. These capsules are often used as a natural alternative for those seeking to address skin concerns without synthetic ingredients. The active compounds in Vitex, such as flavonoids and essential oils, are believed to influence hormone levels that affect skin texture and pore visibility.</p><p>While results may vary, many users report improved skin clarity and a more refined complexion when using Vitex agnus-castus herbal capsules consistently.</p><h2 id="9">9.

Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/camellia-sinensis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis herbal capsules are derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, which is the primary source of green tea and black tea.</p><p>These capsules are often used in herbal formulations for their potential skin benefits, including the reduction of open pores. The active compounds in Camellia sinensis, such as polyphenols and catechins, are believed to help regulate sebum production and improve skin texture.
