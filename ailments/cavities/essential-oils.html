These oils can be diluted with a carrier oil and applied directly to affected areas or used in mouth rinses to provide localized relief and support healing. However, it's important to note that while essential oils may complement traditional dental care, they should not replace professional treatment for existing cavities.</p><p>Always consult with a dentist before using essential oils for oral health concerns to ensure safe and effective use.</p><div class="toc">

When used in dental care routines, cinnamon essential oil may help reduce plaque formation and prevent tooth decay by inhibiting bacterial growth. However, it should be diluted properly before use to avoid irritation of the gums or mucous membranes.</p><p>While it shows promise as a natural remedy, it is not a substitute for professional dental care and should be used as a complementary treatment.</p><h2 id="7">7.
