These oils can be diluted and applied directly to the gums or used in mouth rinses to reduce plaque and promote healing. However, it's important to use them properly and consult a dentist, as some oils may cause irritation if not diluted correctly.</p><p>While they can be a complementary tool in maintaining dental health, they should not replace professional dental care.</p>
