Thuja occidentalis</h2><img alt="thuja occidentalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/thuja-occidentalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Thuja occidentalis herbal capsules are often used as a natural remedy for ingrown toenails due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>These capsules contain extracts from the Eastern arborvitae plant, which is traditionally believed to support skin health and reduce infection risk.
