<p>Herbal teas for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are a natural and non-pharmacological approach to manage the symptoms of this chronic gastrointestinal disorder.</p>
<p>These teas are made from various herbs, plants, and flowers that have anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and carminative properties, which help to soothe the digestive system and alleviate symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movements.</p>
<p>Examples of herbal teas that have been traditionally used to treat IBS include peppermint tea, which helps to relax the muscles in the digestive tract and reduce inflammation; chamomile tea, which calms the nervous system and promotes relaxation; ginger tea, which has anti-inflammatory properties and aids in digestion; fennel tea, which reduces bloating and gas; dandelion tea, which supports liver function and digestion; licorice root tea, which soothes the digestive tract and reduces inflammation; and passionflower tea, which has a calming effect on the nervous system and reduces anxiety.</p>
