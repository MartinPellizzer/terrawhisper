Some studies suggest that these natural remedies may also have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that can reduce gut inflammation and promote intestinal healing. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating herbal mucillages into an IBS management plan, as they may interact with other medications or exacerbate symptoms in certain individuals.</p><p>Overall, herbal mucillages offer a natural and potentially effective complementary approach to managing IBS symptoms when used appropriately.</p>
