Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/glycyrrhiza-glabra-creams.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that licorice-based creams may offer relief for individuals suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by reducing intestinal inflammation and promoting gut healing.

While more clinical research is needed, some patients report decreased bloating, cramping, and discomfort when using licorice herbal creams as part of their IBS management regimen.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare provider before incorporating licorice-based products, as they may interact with certain medications or exacerbate conditions like hypertension.</p><h2 id="10">10.
