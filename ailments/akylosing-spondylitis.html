<p>Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the spine and other joints, causing pain, stiffness, and eventual fusion of the vertebrae.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to treat ankylosing spondylitis due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties, which can help alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression.</p>
<p>Herbs such as turmeric (due to its high curcumin content), ginger (for its anti-inflammatory properties), boswellia (for its ability to reduce joint inflammation), willow bark (containing salicylic acid, similar to aspirin), and devil's claw (for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects) have been traditionally used to treat ankylosing spondylitis.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as turmeric capsules, ginger tea, boswellia oil, willow bark tincture, and devil's claw supplements can be used to treat ankylosing spondylitis, with the latter often recommended in combination with conventional medications to enhance their effectiveness.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes ankylosing spondylitis?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of ankylosing spondylitis are genetic mutations in the HLA-B27 gene, which is responsible for triggering an abnormal immune response in certain individuals.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include infections such as salmonella and certain intestinal bacteria, which can trigger the immune response in people carrying the HLA-B27 gene.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing ankylosing spondylitis include smoking, as it can exacerbate inflammation, and a diet high in processed foods, which can lead to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals with a sedentary lifestyle or those who participate in activities that involve repetitive strain on the spine, such as heavy lifting, may also be at a higher risk.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal ankylosing spondylitis?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat ankylosing spondylitis are Turmeric, Ginger, and Willow Bark, which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that help alleviate symptoms such as pain and stiffness.</p>
<p>Turmeric contains bioactive compounds like curcumin, which has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting COX-2 and NF-kB pathways.</p>
<p>Ginger's therapeutic actions include analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, attributed to its bioactive compounds like gingerol and shogaol, which reduce pain and inflammation by blocking pain receptors and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Willow Bark's salicin content also contributes to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, helping to reduce inflammation and pain in individuals with ankylosing spondylitis.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat ankylosing spondylitis?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat ankylosing spondylitis are often in the form of teas, infusions, and decoctions that are rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds.</p>
<p>Drinking a warm infusion of a bitter, astringent plant can help reduce joint pain and inflammation, while a cool decoction of a soothing, demulcent plant can help calm inflammation and reduce stiffness.</p>
<p>A warm tea made from a plant with anti-arthritic properties can help reduce joint pain and inflammation, while a tincture of a plant with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties can be taken sublingually to help reduce inflammation and promote healing.</p>
<p>Additionally, a topical application of a salve or ointment made from a plant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties can be applied directly to the affected joints to help reduce pain and inflammation.</p>
