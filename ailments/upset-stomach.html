<p>Upset stomach is a common digestive issue characterized by discomfort, nausea, and bloating, often caused by eating spoiled or fatty foods, overeating, or underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat upset stomach, offering a natural and effective solution to alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Certain herbs, such as peppermint, ginger, and fennel, have anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe the digestive tract and reduce nausea, while others like chamomile and licorice root calm the stomach and promote relaxation.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations like teas, infusions, and tinctures, as well as topical applications like essential oils and ointments, can be used to treat upset stomach, with peppermint oil capsules providing quick relief and slippery elm tea offering long-term support.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes upset stomach?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of upset stomach are bacterial infections such as food poisoning from Salmonella or E. coli, and viral infections like norovirus, which can cause inflammation and irritation in the stomach lining.</p>
<p>Secondary causes may include eating spoiled or contaminated food, consuming dairy products by those with lactose intolerance, or taking certain medications like antibiotics or aspirin, which can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria and lead to stomach upset.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing an upset stomach include traveling to areas with poor sanitation, consuming high amounts of spicy or fatty foods, and experiencing stress or anxiety, which can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to stomach infections.</p>
<p>Additionally, people with pre-existing conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are also more prone to experiencing stomach upset due to their underlying condition.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal upset stomach?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat upset stomach are Ginger, Peppermint, and Chamomile, which have been traditionally employed for their anti-inflammatory and carminative properties.</p>
<p>Ginger, in particular, has been shown to exhibit gastroprotective actions through its ability to inhibit the production of stomach acid and relax the smooth muscles in the stomach.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds responsible for these actions include gingerols and shogaols, which have been found to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, Peppermint contains menthol, which helps to relax the smooth muscles and reduce spasms in the digestive tract, while Chamomile's apigenin and luteolin have been found to have a soothing effect on the stomach and reduce inflammation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat upset stomach?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat upset stomach are effective in calming digestive issues due to their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p>
<p>Infusions of warm teas, such as peppermint and ginger-based brews, help to ease nausea and promote digestion by reducing spasms in the stomach.</p>
<p>Tinctures made from certain roots and barks are used to alleviate bloating and discomfort, while herbal decoctions, like those with a specific type of flower, can help to regulate bowel movements and reduce acidity.</p>
<p>Additionally, some herbal preparations, like those made from certain types of seeds, are used to calm the stomach lining and promote the absorption of nutrients.</p>
