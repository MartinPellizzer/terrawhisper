<h2 id="1">1. Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/aloe-barbadensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal teas for its soothing and healing properties, which can be beneficial for cracked heels.</p><p>While aloe vera is more commonly applied topically in gels or ointments, some people incorporate it into herbal teas to harness its internal health benefits. These teas may help improve skin hydration and promote overall skin health, which can support the healing of cracked heels from within. However, it's important to note that aloe vera tea is not a direct treatment for cracked heels and should be used in conjunction with proper foot care.</p><p>For best results, combining aloe-based topical treatments with moisturizing foot creams and regular exfoliation is recommended.</p><h2 id="2">2. Calendula officinalis</h2><img alt="calendula officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/calendula-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Calendula officinalis, commonly known as pot marigold, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas and topical treatments for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, calendula can help promote skin healing and reduce irritation, making it a beneficial remedy for cracked heels. The tea’s gentle nature makes it suitable for daily use, offering hydration and softening effects to dry, rough skin. While it is not a substitute for medical treatment, calendula tea can be a complementary therapy to support the natural healing process of cracked heels.</p><p>Regular application of calendula-infused products, including tea compresses, may help improve the condition of the skin over time.</p><h2 id="3">3.

The tea may help promote skin healing by reducing inflammation and improving moisture retention in the skin. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for cracked heels is limited, and it should not replace proper foot care or medical treatment.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating hypericum perforatum into a skincare routine.</p><h2 id="4">4. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/urtica-dioica-teas.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbal plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its soothing and healing properties.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, it can help alleviate discomfort and promote the healing of cracked heels due to its high content of minerals like silica, which support skin repair. The anti-inflammatory and astringent properties of stinging nettle tea may reduce redness and irritation around the affected area, making it a natural remedy for dry, cracked skin. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using this tea, especially if you have sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p><p>Regular application of stinging nettle tea, either as a foot soak or topical application, may contribute to softer, healthier skin over time.</p><h2 id="5">5.

The tea is often mixed with other soothing herbs like chamomile or calendula to enhance its moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties.

Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/rosa-canina-teas.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas for its rich content of vitamin C and antioxidants, which can support skin health.</p><p>When consumed as a tea, rosa canina may help improve circulation and reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting conditions like cracked heels. The anti-inflammatory properties of rosehip tea may help soothe dry, irritated skin and promote healing. While it is generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it for medical conditions.</p><p>Incorporating rosa canina tea into a holistic skincare routine may complement other treatments for cracked heels, though it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><h2 id="7">7. Cnicus benedictus</h2><img alt="cnicus benedictus tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/cnicus-benedictus-teas.jpg"/><p>Cnicus benedictus, commonly known as blessed thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support skin health and healing.</p><p>When brewed into a herbal tea, it may help soothe and nourish dry, cracked heels by promoting skin regeneration and reducing inflammation.

To use blessed thistle for cracked heels, one can apply the cooled tea topically or consume it internally to support overall skin health.</p><p>While it is generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="8">8. Symphytum officinale</h2><img alt="symphytum officinale tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/symphytum-officinale-teas.jpg"/><p>Symphytum officinale, commonly known as comfrey, is a traditional herbal plant that has been used for centuries to promote skin healing and regeneration.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal tea, it may help soothe and repair cracked heels by stimulating the production of collagen and enhancing skin elasticity. However, it is important to note that comfrey contains allantoin, which can be absorbed through the skin and may pose risks with prolonged use, especially for those with open wounds or sensitive skin. As a result, it is generally recommended to use comfrey topical preparations rather than internal teas for treating cracked heels.</p><p>Always consult with a healthcare professional before using comfrey, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are pregnant.</p><h2 id="9">9. Chamomilla recutita</h2><img alt="chamomilla recutita tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/chamomilla-recutita-teas.jpg"/><p>Chamomilla recutita, commonly known as German chamomile, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, it can help moisturize and soften the skin, making it beneficial for treating cracked heels.
