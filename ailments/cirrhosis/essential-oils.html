These oils are often used in aromatherapy, but their impact on liver metabolism and detoxification processes remains understudied, necessitating further clinical research. Patients with cirrhosis should consult healthcare professionals before using any essential oils to avoid potential hepatotoxic effects or interactions with existing treatments.</p><p>Overall, while herbal essential oils may provide complementary support, they should not replace conventional medical care for cirrhosis.</p>
