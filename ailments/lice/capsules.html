Unlike chemical treatments, herbal capsules are generally considered safer for children and less likely to cause resistance in lice populations. They work by either repelling lice or weakening their grip on the hair shaft, making them easier to remove.</p><p>However, while they may offer a gentler alternative, they may require more frequent use and are often used in conjunction with combing to achieve effective results.</p>
