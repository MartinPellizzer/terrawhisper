<h2 id="0">What causes shortness of breath?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of shortness of breath are conditions that affect the lungs or heart, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic bronchitis.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include obesity, sleep apnea, and anemia, which can lead to shortness of breath due to decreased lung capacity, increased air resistance, and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.</p>
<p>Lifestyle factors that increase the chances of developing shortness of breath include smoking, physical inactivity, and poor air quality, which can damage lung tissue and reduce lung function.</p>
<p>Additionally, high-altitude living and occupations that involve heavy lifting or prolonged standing can also contribute to shortness of breath due to increased respiratory demands.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal shortness of breath?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat shortness of breath are Ashwagandha, Licorice root, and Ginkgo biloba, which are known for their adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory properties.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha's withanolides and Ginkgo biloba's flavonoids and bilobalide have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve lung function.</p>
<p>Licorice root's glycyrrhizin and Ginkgo biloba's flavonoids have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects, reducing bronchospasm and improving airway resistance.</p>
<p>These herbs can be used in teas, infusions, or extracts to help alleviate shortness of breath symptoms and promote overall respiratory health.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat shortness of breath?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat shortness of breath are consumed as teas, infusions, or tinctures, and they often work by reducing inflammation in the airways, thinning mucus, or increasing oxygen delivery to the body.</p>
<p>Drinking a warm infusion or tea before bed can help alleviate night-time symptoms, while a cooled and sweetened infusion may provide relief during the day.</p>
<p>Some herbal preparations, such as those made with expectorant properties, can help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe.</p>
<p>Others, with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can help repair damaged lung tissue and reduce the severity of symptoms.</p>
