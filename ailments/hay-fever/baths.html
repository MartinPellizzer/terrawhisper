To prepare an herbal bath, simply steep a handful of dried herbs in hot water, let it cool, and then add it to a warm bath, ensuring the water is not too hot to avoid skin irritation. Soaking in the bath for 15 to 20 minutes can help open up the airways and ease nasal congestion.</p><p>While herbal baths are not a cure for hay fever, they can complement other treatments and provide relief from seasonal allergy symptoms.</p><div class="toc">
