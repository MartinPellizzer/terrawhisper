While some studies suggest that St. John's Wort may have antihistaminic properties, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy for allergic rhinitis. Herbal teas made from Hypericum perforatum are often consumed as a natural alternative to conventional antihistamines, though they should not replace prescribed treatments without consulting a healthcare professional.</p><p>It is important to note that St. John's Wort can interact with various medications, so caution is advised when using it alongside other treatments.</p><h2 id="8">8.
