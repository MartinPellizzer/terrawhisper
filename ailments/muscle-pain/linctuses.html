The herb is believed to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that may help reduce muscle tension and soreness. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex for muscle pain, as it may interact with certain medications or have contraindications for specific health conditions.</p><p>Overall, vitex agnus-castus may be considered a complementary option for managing mild muscle discomfort when used under proper guidance.</p><h2 id="2">2.
