The active compounds in valerian, such as valerenic acid, may interact with the central nervous system to enhance sleep onset and duration. While some studies suggest valerian may be effective for mild sleep disturbances, its role in specifically addressing jet lag remains inconclusive and requires further research.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using valerian capsules for travel-related sleep issues.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal capsules containing vitex agnus-castus are often used as a natural alternative to synthetic sleep aids, especially for those seeking non-pharmaceutical options. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting its effectiveness for jet lag is limited, and more studies are needed to confirm its role in circadian rhythm regulation.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before using vitex agnus-castus, particularly for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3.

However, it is important to note that while some individuals may find benefit from licorice root, its effects can vary, and it should not replace professional medical advice.</p><p>As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with hypertension or other health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum capsule" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, contains a compound called piperine, which has been studied for its potential to support circadian rhythm regulation.</p><p>Herbal capsules made from Piper nigrum may help alleviate symptoms of jet lag by influencing the body's internal clock through its interaction with neurotransmitters and metabolic processes.
