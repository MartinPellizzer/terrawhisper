<h2 id="1">1. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/valeriana-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When taken in the form of herbal capsules, valerian may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Its sedative properties are believed to enhance the effects of melatonin, the hormone crucial for regulating sleep patterns. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using valerian, especially if you are on medication or have underlying health conditions.</p><p>While some studies suggest valerian may be beneficial for sleep, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness specifically for jet lag.</p><h2 id="2">2. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/vitex-agnus-castus-capsules.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal supplement that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and regulate the menstrual cycle.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for jet lag, some studies suggest that it may help regulate the body's internal clock by influencing melatonin production and circadian rhythms. Herbal capsules containing vitex agnus-castus are often taken in the evening to promote relaxation and support a restful sleep, which can be beneficial for individuals adjusting to new time zones. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex for jet lag, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><p>Overall, while not a primary remedy for jet lag, vitex agnus-castus may offer supportive benefits when used as part of a holistic approach to managing travel-related sleep disturbances.</p><h2 id="3">3. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/glycyrrhiza-glabra-capsules.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used for its potential adaptogenic properties, which may help the body manage stress and adjust to changes in schedules.</p><p>Herbal capsules containing glycyrrhiza glabra are sometimes used by individuals to alleviate the symptoms of jet lag, such as fatigue, irritability, and difficulty sleeping. While some studies suggest that licorice root may support adrenal function and help regulate cortisol levels, its effectiveness for jet lag specifically is not well-documented in clinical trials. It is important to note that licorice root can have side effects, including increased blood pressure, and should be used with caution, especially for those with hypertension or on certain medications.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using glycyrrhiza glabra for jet lag or any other health condition.</p><h2 id="4">4. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis)</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/melissa-officinalis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When taken in the form of herbal capsules, it may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythms. The calming effects of lemon balm can help reduce anxiety and restlessness often associated with time zone changes. Some studies suggest that its mild sedative properties may enhance sleep duration and quality, aiding in quicker recovery after long flights.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using lemon balm, especially if you are on medication or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Black pepper (Piper nigrum)</h2><img alt="piper nigrum capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/piper-nigrum-capsules.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is often used in herbal formulations to support digestion and enhance nutrient absorption.</p><p>While not a direct treatment for jet lag, some studies suggest that the compounds in black pepper, such as piperine, may help regulate circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality. Herbal capsules containing piper nigrum are sometimes recommended as a natural supplement to aid in adjusting to time zone changes. These capsules are generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses, though they may interact with certain medications.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using piper nigrum supplements for jet lag, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. European plum (Prunus domestica)</h2><img alt="prunus domestica capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/prunus-domestica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Prunus domestica, commonly known as the European blackberry or blackthorn, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits.</p><p>While it is not a well-established remedy specifically for jet lag, some studies suggest that its high antioxidant content may support overall well-being during periods of travel and time zone changes. Herbal capsules containing Prunus domestica are often marketed for their digestive and immune-boosting properties, which could indirectly aid in managing the stress of jet lag. However, there is limited scientific evidence directly linking Prunus domestica to the mitigation of jet lag symptoms.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa)</h2><img alt="cimicifuga racemosa capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/cimicifuga-racemosa-capsules.jpg"/><p>Cimicifuga racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms of menopause.</p><p>While it is not specifically marketed for jet lag, some studies suggest that its adaptogenic properties may help the body adjust to changes in time zones by reducing stress and fatigue. Herbal capsules containing Cimicifuga racemosa are often taken in the evening to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, which can be beneficial for travelers experiencing disrupted circadian rhythms. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using this herb, especially for individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>Overall, while Cimicifuga racemosa may offer some supportive benefits for jet lag, it should be used as part of a broader strategy that includes proper sleep hygiene and light exposure adjustments.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/echinacea-purpurea-capsules.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal capsules are often used for their potential immune-boosting properties, which may help the body recover more quickly from the stress of jet lag.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking echinacea to the treatment of jet lag, some individuals find that it supports overall wellness during travel. These capsules are typically made from the dried flowers and roots of the echinacea plant, and they are available in various formulations. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><p>Although not a cure for jet lag, echinacea may be a complementary supplement to support general health during long-haul flights and time zone changes.</p><h2 id="9">9. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)</h2><img alt="withania somnifera capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/withania-somnifera-capsules.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to reduce stress and promote relaxation.</p><p>When formulated into herbal capsules, it may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. The adaptogenic properties of ashwagandha may help the body manage the physiological stress of crossing time zones, potentially reducing fatigue and improving overall well-being during travel. Some studies suggest that ashwagandha may influence cortisol levels and melatonin production, both of which are critical for sleep regulation.</p><p>While it is not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene, ashwagandha herbal capsules may serve as a complementary aid for managing jet lag when used in conjunction with other strategies.</p><h2 id="10">10. Nux vomica (Strychnos nux-vomica)</h2><img alt="strychnos nux-vomica capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/strychnos-nux-vomica-capsules.jpg"/><p>Strychnos nux-vomica, also known as Chinese wild chili or devil's backbone, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used in Chinese medicine for centuries.</p><p>While it is not commonly recommended for jet lag, some practitioners suggest it may help regulate sleep patterns due to its purported effects on the nervous system. However, it is important to note that Strychnos nux-vomica contains toxic compounds, such as strychnine, which can be harmful if not properly prepared or dosed. As a result, it is generally not advised for use in herbal capsules for jet lag without professional supervision.</p><p>Instead, safer alternatives like melatonin supplements or adaptogenic herbs are often recommended for managing travel-related sleep disturbances.</p>
