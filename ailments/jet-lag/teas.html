Its calming properties can reduce anxiety and fatigue, which are common during travel across time zones. However, it is important to note that valerian tea should be consumed in moderation and ideally under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>While it may offer some relief, it is not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene and gradual adjustment to new time zones.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Drinking a cup of green tea in the morning can help synchronize the body’s internal clock with the new time zone, while avoiding consumption too close to bedtime can prevent disruptions to sleep.
