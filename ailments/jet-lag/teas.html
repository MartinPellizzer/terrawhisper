<h2 id="1">1. Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/valeriana-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a herbal remedy often used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When brewed into a tea, valerian can help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythms. Its calming effects may help reduce anxiety and restlessness that often accompany long-haul flights and time zone changes. However, it is important to note that valerian tea should be consumed in moderation and ideally in the evening to avoid disrupting sleep patterns.</p><p>While it may offer some relief, it is best used in conjunction with other strategies such as adjusting sleep schedules and exposure to natural light.</p><h2 id="2">2. Camellia (Camellia sinensis)</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/camellia-sinensis-teas.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green, black, and white teas are derived, contains compounds that may help alleviate symptoms of jet lag by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality.</p><p>The mild caffeine content in herbal teas made from Camellia sinensis can help regulate the body's circadian rhythm when consumed in moderation, especially when adjusted to the local time zone of the destination. These teas also contain antioxidants and L-theanine, which can reduce stress and enhance mental clarity, both of which are beneficial during travel across time zones. Drinking Camellia sinensis herbal teas in the evening can signal the body to wind down, aiding in the adjustment to new sleep schedules.</p><p>However, it is important to avoid excessive caffeine intake, as it may disrupt sleep patterns and exacerbate jet lag symptoms.</p><h2 id="3">3. Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum)</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/cinnamomum-verum-teas.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, is often used in herbal teas to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag due to its mild warming properties and potential calming effects.</p><p>This spice contains compounds like cinnamaldehyde and essential oils that may support the body's natural circadian rhythms when consumed in tea form. Drinking cinnamon tea can help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, which are crucial for recovering from the disruptions caused by cross-time zone travel. It is typically prepared by steeping a small amount of cinnamon bark in hot water, and can be enjoyed either on its own or combined with other calming herbs like chamomile or lemon balm.</p><p>While it is not a cure for jet lag, cinnamon tea may serve as a complementary remedy to help ease the transition and support overall well-being during travel.</p><h2 id="4">4. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/glycyrrhiza-glabra-teas.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal teas to support the body's natural rhythms and potentially alleviate symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>This herb contains compounds like glycyrrhizin and flavonoids, which may help regulate cortisol levels and reduce inflammation, both of which can be disrupted by sudden time zone changes. Drinking licorice root tea may help ease fatigue, improve mood, and support adrenal function, which is often stressed during travel across time zones. However, it is important to note that licorice root can have side effects, such as increased blood pressure, and should be consumed in moderation.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using licorice root tea for jet lag, especially for those with existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Maypop (Passiflora incarnata)</h2><img alt="passiflora incarnata tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/passiflora-incarnata-teas.jpg"/><p>Passiflora incarnata, also known as passionflower, is a herbal tea that has been traditionally used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, making it a potential aid for combating jet lag.</p><p>This herb contains compounds like flavonoids and antioxidants that may help reduce anxiety and support the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle. Drinking passionflower tea in the evening can help ease the transition to a new time zone by encouraging deeper, more restful sleep. Its mild sedative effects may help travelers adjust to different daylight schedules more quickly.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using passionflower, especially for those on medication or with existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6. Ginger (Zingiber officinale)</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/zingiber-officinale-teas.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, is a popular herbal ingredient used in teas to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>The warming and stimulating properties of ginger can aid in improving digestion and boosting energy levels, which are often disrupted during travel across time zones. Drinking ginger tea before bedtime may help regulate sleep patterns by promoting relaxation and reducing nausea, common side effects of jet lag. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in ginger support overall well-being during long flights and recovery from fatigue.</p><p>Incorporating zingiber officinale into a daily herbal tea routine can be a natural and soothing way to manage the challenges of crossing time zones.</p><h2 id="7">7. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis)</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/melissa-officinalis-teas.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a herb often used in herbal teas to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>This calming herb is believed to support the body’s natural circadian rhythm by promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety, which are common during travel across time zones. Drinking lemon balm tea in the evening can help ease the transition to a new time zone by encouraging restful sleep, while consuming it in the morning may aid in adjusting to a new day cycle. Its mild, pleasant flavor makes it a pleasant and soothing addition to a traveler’s routine.</p><p>Overall, lemon balm herbal tea offers a natural and gentle way to manage the stress and fatigue associated with jet lag.</p><h2 id="8">8. Black pepper (Piper nigrum)</h2><img alt="piper nigrum tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/piper-nigrum-teas.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is not typically used in herbal teas for jet lag, but its active compound, piperine, may support circadian rhythm regulation.</p><p>While black pepper itself is not a traditional remedy for jet lag, some herbal teas blend it with other ingredients like ginger or valerian root to promote relaxation and digestion. These combinations can help ease the physical discomfort associated with travel and potentially aid in adjusting to new time zones. However, it's important to note that more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness specifically for jet lag.</p><p>For best results, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedy for travel-related sleep disturbances.</p><h2 id="9">9. European plum (Prunus domestica)</h2><img alt="prunus domestica tea" src="/images/preparations/teas/prunus-domestica-teas.jpg"/><p>Prunus domestica, commonly known as the European plum, is a traditional herb used in herbal teas to help alleviate symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>The tea is believed to support the body's natural circadian rhythms due to its mild sedative and calming properties. Rich in antioxidants and nutrients, it may help reduce fatigue and promote relaxation after long flights. While it is not a cure for jet lag, it can be a soothing addition to a wellness routine during travel.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking medications.</p><h2 id="10">10.

Its natural stimulant effects can be beneficial when consumed in the morning to help wake the body up after a long flight.</p><p>Overall, peppermint herbal tea offers a natural and calming remedy to support the body's adaptation to time zone changes.</p>
