<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis syrup" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-syrups.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a herbal remedy often used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>Herbal syrups made from valerian root are popular for their calming effects, which can help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting better sleep patterns. These syrups work by interacting with the central nervous system to reduce anxiety and enhance sleep onset, making them a natural alternative to pharmaceutical sleep aids. While valerian is generally considered safe for short-term use, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using it, especially for individuals with existing medical conditions or those taking other medications.</p><p>When used as part of a broader strategy to adjust to new time zones, valerian herbal syrups may offer a gentle and effective way to combat the fatigue and disrupted sleep associated with jet lag.</p><h2 id="2">2. Melissa officinalis</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis syrup" src="/images/preparations/melissa-officinalis-syrups.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a herb often used in herbal syrups to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>These syrups are believed to support the body's natural rhythms by promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety, which are common during travel across time zones. The calming properties of lemon balm may help regulate sleep patterns and ease the transition to a new time zone. While scientific evidence is limited, many people find these syrups beneficial for their soothing effects.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra syrup" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-syrups.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into a syrup, licorice root may support adrenal function and help the body manage stress, which is particularly beneficial for travelers experiencing jet lag. While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking licorice syrup to the treatment of jet lag, some studies suggest that its adaptogenic qualities may aid in regulating the body's circadian rhythm. However, it is important to note that licorice root can increase blood pressure and should be used with caution, especially in individuals with hypertension.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice syrup for jet lag or any other health condition.</p><h2 id="4">4. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea syrup" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal syrups are traditionally used to support immune function and reduce inflammation, but they are not specifically formulated for treating jet lag.</p><p>While some individuals may use echinacea to boost their energy levels during travel, there is limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness in alleviating jet lag symptoms. Jet lag is primarily caused by disruptions to the body's circadian rhythm, which is regulated by exposure to light and darkness. Therefore, the most effective strategies for managing jet lag typically involve adjusting sleep schedules, exposure to natural light, and maintaining a consistent routine.</p><p>Although echinacea may offer general wellness benefits, it should not be relied upon as a primary treatment for jet lag without consulting a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="5">5. Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum syrup" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is traditionally used in herbal medicine for its stimulating and digestive properties.</p><p>While not a direct treatment for jet lag, some herbal syrups containing black pepper extract are believed to support the bodyâ€™s natural rhythms by enhancing metabolic function and promoting alertness. These syrups may help ease the transition across time zones by improving energy levels and reducing fatigue. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence supporting the use of black pepper syrups for jet lag is limited, and they should be used in conjunction with other established strategies such as adjusting sleep schedules and light exposure.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="6">6. Rhodiola rosea</h2><img alt="rhodiola rosea syrup" src="/images/preparations/rhodiola-rosea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Rhodiola rosea, also known as the "golden root," is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used to enhance physical and mental performance under stress.</p><p>Herbal syrups containing rhodiola rosea are increasingly popular for managing jet lag due to their potential to support energy levels and reduce fatigue. These syrups may help regulate the body's circadian rhythm by influencing neurotransmitter activity and hormonal balance. Studies suggest that rhodiola can improve alertness and cognitive function, which are often impaired during travel across time zones.</p><p>When taken as part of a holistic approach to managing jet lag, rhodiola rosea syrups may offer a natural and effective complement to rest, hydration, and light exposure adjustments.</p><h2 id="7">7. Passiflora incarnata</h2><img alt="passiflora incarnata syrup" src="/images/preparations/passiflora-incarnata-syrups.jpg"/><p>Passiflora incarnata, also known as the passionflower, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When formulated into a herbal syrup, it can be an effective natural aid for managing the symptoms of jet lag, particularly insomnia and anxiety that often accompany time zone changes. The calming properties of passiflora incarnata are believed to support the body's adjustment to new circadian rhythms by enhancing sleep onset and duration. This herbal syrup is typically taken in small doses before bedtime to help ease the transition to a new time zone.</p><p>It is generally considered safe for most adults, though it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with existing health conditions or on other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum syrup" src="/images/preparations/cinnamomum-verum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, commonly known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its calming and soothing properties.</p><p>When prepared as a herbal syrup, it may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by promoting relaxation and supporting the body's natural rhythms. The essential oils in cinnamon, such as cinnamaldehyde, are believed to have mild sedative effects that can aid in improving sleep quality during time zone changes. To use cinnamon syrup for jet lag, it is typically recommended to take a small dose before bedtime in the destination time zone.</p><p>While it is not a cure-all, some individuals find that incorporating cinnamon syrup into their routine can complement other strategies for managing jet lag more effectively.</p><h2 id="9">9. Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare syrup" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-syrups.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its digestive and calming properties.</p><p>Fennel herbal syrups are often prepared using the dried seeds of the plant, which are rich in essential oils and antioxidants. Some studies suggest that fennel may help regulate the body's circadian rhythm, potentially aiding in the adjustment of sleep patterns during jet lag. While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking fennel syrup to jet lag relief, many individuals report feeling more relaxed and less anxious after using it.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating fennel syrup into a jet lag management routine.</p><h2 id="10">10.
