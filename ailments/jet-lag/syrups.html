Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/glycyrrhiza-glabra-syrups.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When formulated into a syrup, it may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's stress response and promoting relaxation.

However, it is important to note that while some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for jet lag specifically.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis)</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/melissa-officinalis-syrups.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a popular herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and ease stress.</p><p>When formulated into a herbal syrup, it can support the body’s natural ability to adjust to time zone changes, making it a useful aid for managing jet lag.

Herbal syrups containing Cimicifuga racemosa are often used as a natural alternative to pharmaceutical sleep aids or stimulants for managing sleep patterns during travel. However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before use, as it may interact with other medications or have side effects in certain individuals.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, more clinical trials are needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for addressing jet lag.</p><h2 id="5">5. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)</h2><img alt="withania somnifera syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/withania-somnifera-syrups.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb that has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to support overall health and well-being.</p><p>When formulated into herbal syrups, ashwagandha may help regulate the body's stress response and promote better sleep, which can be beneficial for individuals experiencing jet lag. The adaptogenic properties of ashwagandha may assist in balancing the body's circadian rhythms, potentially reducing the symptoms of fatigue and irritability associated with time zone changes. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using ashwagandha syrups, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><p>While some studies suggest potential benefits, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety for managing jet lag.</p><h2 id="6">6. Maypop (Passiflora incarnata)</h2><img alt="passiflora incarnata syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/passiflora-incarnata-syrups.jpg"/><p>Passiflora incarnata, commonly known as passionflower, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When formulated into a herbal syrup, it can be an effective aid for managing the symptoms of jet lag, particularly insomnia and anxiety caused by disrupted circadian rhythms. The active compounds in passionflower, such as flavonoids and harmine, are believed to have calming effects on the nervous system, helping to ease the transition to new time zones. This natural syrup is often preferred over pharmaceutical sleep aids due to its mild side effect profile and potential for long-term use.</p><p>To maximize its benefits, it is best taken in the evening or as directed, alongside other jet lag management strategies like maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and exposing oneself to natural light.</p><h2 id="7">7. Chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus)</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/vitex-agnus-castus-syrups.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may help alleviate symptoms associated with jet lag.</p><p>While scientific evidence on its direct impact on jet lag is limited, some studies suggest that it may help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce anxiety, which can be beneficial during travel across time zones. Herbal syrups containing vitex agnus-castus are often used as a natural alternative to synthetic supplements, offering a gentler approach to managing the stress and discomfort of travel. These syrups are typically easy to incorporate into a daily routine, making them a convenient option for travelers seeking natural support.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using vitex agnus-castus, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/echinacea-purpurea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal syrups are traditionally used to support immune function and reduce the duration of colds and flu, but they are not specifically formulated or scientifically proven to treat jet lag.</p><p>While some people may use echinacea to boost their overall wellness during travel, it does not directly address the circadian rhythm disruption that causes jet lag. Jet lag is primarily managed through light exposure, sleep schedules, and melatonin supplementation, rather than herbal remedies like echinacea. However, the calming and mild stimulant properties of echinacea might help some individuals feel more alert or relaxed during travel.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal supplements, especially when traveling across time zones.</p><h2 id="9">9. Kava (Piper methysticum)</h2><img alt="piper methysticum syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/piper-methysticum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Piper methysticum, commonly known as kava, is a traditional herbal plant native to the South Pacific islands, and its root has been used for centuries for its calming and sedative effects.</p><p>While kava is not typically used as a syrup, some herbal formulations may incorporate it into a syrup form to enhance its bioavailability and ease of consumption. These kava syrups are sometimes marketed for their potential to help with sleep and relaxation, which could indirectly support the body's adjustment to time zone changes during jet lag. However, it's important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting the use of kava syrups specifically for treating jet lag.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using kava or any other herbal remedy, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="10">10. Golden root (Rhodiola rosea)</h2><img alt="rhodiola rosea syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/rhodiola-rosea-syrups.jpg"/><p>Rhodiola rosea, a popular adaptogenic herb, is commonly used in herbal syrups to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's ability to cope with stress and fatigue.</p><p>These syrups are believed to enhance mental clarity, reduce exhaustion, and regulate the body's circadian rhythm, which is often disrupted during long flights across time zones. The active compounds in Rhodiola rosea, such as rosavins and salidrosides, may help improve energy levels and mood, making them a natural remedy for travelers. When taken before or after crossing time zones, these syrups can aid in adjusting to new schedules more quickly.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before using Rhodiola rosea, especially for those with existing health conditions or who are taking other medications.</p>
