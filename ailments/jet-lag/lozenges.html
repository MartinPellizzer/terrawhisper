<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>Valerian root extract is often incorporated into herbal lozenges to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythms. These lozenges work by calming the nervous system and reducing anxiety, which are common side effects of disrupted sleep patterns due to time zone changes. When taken regularly before bedtime in the destination time zone, valerian lozenges may help users fall asleep more easily and improve overall rest.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using valerian, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Melissa officinalis</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis lozenge" src="/images/preparations/melissa-officinalis-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a mild herbal remedy often used to support relaxation and reduce anxiety.</p><p>Lemon balm herbal lozenges are formulated to provide a soothing effect on the throat while promoting calmness, making them a potential aid for managing the stress and fatigue associated with jet lag. These lozenges may help regulate sleep patterns by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythm, which is often disrupted during long-haul travel. The calming properties of lemon balm can also ease the mental strain of adjusting to new time zones, contributing to an overall sense of well-being.</p><p>While not a cure for jet lag, Melissa officinalis lozenges may offer a natural and complementary approach to easing the symptoms of travel-related fatigue.</p><h2 id="3">3. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used for its soothing effects on the respiratory system and its potential to reduce inflammation.</p><p>Herbal lozenges made from glycyrrhiza glabra may help alleviate throat irritation and coughing, which are common symptoms during long flights. While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking licorice root to the treatment of jet lag, some studies suggest that its adaptogenic properties may support the body's ability to cope with stress, such as that experienced during rapid time zone changes. These lozenges are often used as a natural remedy to ease the discomfort associated with air travel.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using licorice root, especially for prolonged periods or in individuals with hypertension or kidney issues.</p><h2 id="4">4. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus lozenge" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may help regulate the body's internal clock, making it a potential aid for managing jet lag.</p><p>Herbal lozenges containing Vitex agnus-castus are designed to be convenient and easy to incorporate into daily routines, offering a natural alternative to conventional remedies. These lozenges are often formulated with additional calming herbs to promote relaxation and support the body's adjustment to new time zones. While scientific evidence on their effectiveness for jet lag is limited, many users report improved sleep patterns and reduced symptoms of fatigue when using Vitex-based products.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with existing medical conditions or taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties, and herbal lozenges made from this root may offer relief for symptoms associated with jet lag.</p><p>These lozenges can help alleviate nausea, a common side effect of crossing time zones, by soothing the digestive system and reducing gastrointestinal discomfort. Ginger also has mild stimulant effects that may help improve alertness and energy levels, which can be beneficial during the adjustment period to a new time zone. Additionally, the aromatic compounds in ginger may promote relaxation and reduce stress, which often accompanies travel and disrupted sleep patterns.</p><p>While not a cure for jet lag, incorporating ginger lozenges into a routine may support overall well-being and ease the transition during international travel.</p><h2 id="6">6. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea lozenge" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea herbal lozenges are commonly used to support the immune system and may offer additional benefits for managing the effects of jet lag.</p><p>These lozenges contain echinacea, a flowering plant known for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. While there is limited direct research on echinacea's impact on jet lag specifically, some studies suggest that adaptogenic herbs can help the body adjust to changes in circadian rhythms. By reducing stress and enhancing immune function, echinacea lozenges may aid in recovery from the physical strain of traveling across time zones.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using echinacea, especially for individuals with allergies or chronic health conditions.</p><h2 id="7">7.

These lozenges may aid in improving oral health and reducing throat irritation, which can be beneficial during long flights. However, it is important to note that they should not be considered a primary treatment for jet lag, as the condition is best managed through proper sleep schedules, hydration, and light exposure.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before use, especially for those with allergies or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Cimicifuga racemosa</h2><img alt="cimicifuga racemosa lozenge" src="/images/preparations/cimicifuga-racemosa-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Cimicifuga racemosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is an herbal remedy that has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and alleviate symptoms of menopause.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for jet lag, some studies suggest that its adaptogenic properties may help the body manage stress and adjust to new time zones more effectively.

These lozenges are typically made from standardized extracts of the root and are available in various formulations for ease of consumption.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using them, especially for individuals with hormone-sensitive conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="9">9.

Typically made from a combination of herbal ingredients, including nux vomica, they are designed for easy consumption and can be taken before bedtime to support restful sleep.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p>
