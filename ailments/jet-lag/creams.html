<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, valerian may offer localized relief for muscle tension and stress-related discomfort, which can be common during long flights or travel. These creams typically contain valerian root extract, which is believed to have mild sedative properties that may help alleviate the effects of jet lag by supporting restful sleep. While not a cure for jet lag, valerian-based creams can be a complementary tool for those seeking natural ways to ease the symptoms of travel fatigue.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such products, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2. Melissa officinalis</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/melissa-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a calming herb often used in herbal creams to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>These creams typically contain essential oils and extracts from lemon balm leaves, which are known for their soothing and relaxing properties. When applied topically, the cream may help reduce anxiety and promote better sleep, which are common issues for travelers suffering from jet lag. The natural ingredients in melissa officinalis creams are believed to support the body’s ability to adjust to new time zones by regulating stress hormones.</p><p>While not a cure-all, these creams can be a complementary aid in managing the discomforts associated with jet lag.</p><h2 id="3">3. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea cream" src="/images/preparations/echinacea-purpurea-creams.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is traditionally used for its immune-boosting properties, but recent research suggests it may also offer benefits for managing jet lag.</p><p>Some studies indicate that echinacea-containing creams might help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are often exacerbated by the body's response to disrupted circadian rhythms during travel. While there is limited direct evidence linking echinacea to the treatment of jet lag, its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects could potentially support overall recovery after long-haul flights. Herbal creams infused with echinacea are sometimes used as part of a holistic approach to alleviate the physical discomfort associated with jet lag.</p><p>However, more scientific research is needed to confirm their efficacy and safety for this specific purpose.</p><h2 id="4">4. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale cream" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-creams.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties, and recent research suggests it may also offer benefits in alleviating symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, the active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, may help improve circulation and reduce muscle tension, which are common complaints during travel across time zones. These creams can be applied topically to the neck, shoulders, or feet to promote relaxation and ease the body's transition to a new time zone. While not a cure for jet lag, ginger-based creams may support overall well-being and reduce the discomfort associated with sleep disruption.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for those with sensitive skin or existing medical conditions.</p><h2 id="5">5. Withania somnifera</h2><img alt="withania somnifera cream" src="/images/preparations/withania-somnifera-creams.jpg"/><p>Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is an adaptogenic herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to support stress relief and improve sleep quality.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for jet lag, some studies suggest that its calming properties may help regulate the body's circadian rhythms when used in conjunction with other strategies. Herbal creams containing ashwagandha are often marketed for their soothing effects on the skin and their potential to reduce stress and fatigue, which can be beneficial for travelers experiencing jet lag. However, it is important to note that these creams are not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene, light exposure adjustments, or time zone adaptation techniques.</p><p>For effective management of jet lag, it is recommended to combine ashwagandha-based products with established sleep support practices.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus cream" src="/images/preparations/vitex-agnus-castus-creams.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, is often used in herbal remedies to support hormonal balance and may be incorporated into creams designed to alleviate symptoms of jet lag.</p><p>These creams typically combine chasteberry extract with other calming ingredients like lavender or chamomile to promote relaxation and ease the body’s adjustment to new time zones. While there is limited scientific evidence directly linking vitex-based creams to the treatment of jet lag, some users report improved sleep quality and reduced anxiety when using such products. The calming properties of these creams may help regulate the body’s circadian rhythm, potentially easing the transition across time zones.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="7">7. Cirsium arvense</h2><img alt="cirsium arvense cream" src="/images/preparations/cirsium-arvense-creams.jpg"/><p>Cirsium arvense, commonly known as common sandthistle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits.</p><p>While it is not a direct treatment for jet lag, some herbal creams containing Cirsium arvense may help alleviate the physical discomfort associated with travel, such as muscle tension and fatigue. These creams are often used topically to promote circulation and reduce swelling, which can be beneficial for individuals experiencing the physical toll of long-haul flights. However, there is limited scientific evidence supporting the use of Cirsium arvense creams specifically for jet lag, and they should not replace established strategies like adjusting sleep schedules or light exposure.</p><p>It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies for travel-related health concerns.</p><h2 id="8">8. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica cream" src="/images/preparations/urtica-dioica-creams.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a plant that has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits.</p><p>Some herbal creams containing Urtica dioica are marketed for their potential to alleviate symptoms associated with jet lag, such as fatigue and muscle aches. These creams may help improve circulation and reduce inflammation, which can support the body's recovery after long flights.

Lavandula angustifolia</h2><img alt="lavandula angustifolia cream" src="/images/preparations/lavandula-angustifolia-creams.jpg"/><p>Lavandula angustifolia, commonly known as English lavender, is often incorporated into herbal creams for its calming and soothing properties.</p><p>These creams are believed to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality, which are essential for recovery after long flights. The essential oils in lavender are known to have mild sedative effects, which may aid in reducing anxiety and helping the body adjust to new time zones more quickly. While scientific evidence on its effectiveness for jet lag is limited, many travelers find comfort in using lavender-based products for their aromatherapeutic benefits.</p><p>Overall, lavender herbal creams offer a natural and aromatic option for those seeking relief from the physical and mental stress associated with jet lag.</p><h2 id="10">10. Rosa canina</h2><img alt="rosa canina cream" src="/images/preparations/rosa-canina-creams.jpg"/><p>Rosa canina, also known as rosehip, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to support skin health and overall well-being.</p><p>Rosa canina herbal creams are formulated with the essential oils and extracts of the rosehip plant, which are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. These creams are often marketed for their ability to reduce the effects of jet lag by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality.
