<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/valeriana-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, valerian may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythms. The active compounds in valerian, such as valerenic acid, are believed to interact with the central nervous system to reduce anxiety and enhance sleep, which are often disrupted during travel across time zones. While scientific evidence on its effectiveness for jet lag is limited, many users report improved sleep patterns and reduced fatigue after using valerian juice.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating valerian into a jet lag management routine.</p><h2 id="2">2. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/glycyrrhiza-glabra-juices.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, has been traditionally used for its adaptogenic properties, which may help the body manage stress and fatigue.</p><p>Herbal juices made from licorice root are believed to support adrenal function and balance cortisol levels, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing jet lag. The anti-inflammatory and soothing effects of licorice juice may also aid in reducing throat irritation and promoting overall wellness during travel. While more research is needed, some studies suggest that licorice root may improve sleep quality and reduce the symptoms of fatigue associated with time zone changes.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using licorice-based herbal juices, especially for those with hypertension or other health conditions.</p><h2 id="3">3. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/mentha-piperita-juices.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often used in herbal juices to help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag due to its calming and digestive properties.</p><p>The refreshing aroma and invigorating taste of peppermint can help stimulate alertness and ease the transition to a new time zone. Peppermint juice is believed to support the body's natural circadian rhythms by promoting digestion and reducing nausea, which are common during long flights. When consumed in moderation, it can provide a natural alternative to caffeine for boosting energy without the jitters.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using peppermint juice, especially for those with existing health conditions or medications.</p><h2 id="4">4. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/echinacea-purpurea-juices.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a traditional herbal remedy often used to support immune function and reduce inflammation.</p><p>While it is not a direct cure for jet lag, some studies suggest that its adaptogenic properties may help the body adjust to time zone changes more quickly. Herbal juices containing echinacea are believed to promote overall vitality and may assist in managing the stress and fatigue associated with crossing time zones. These juices are typically consumed in small amounts throughout the day to support energy levels and immune health during travel.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using echinacea, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="5">5. Curcuma longa</h2><img alt="curcuma longa juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/curcuma-longa-juices.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, contains curcumin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Some studies suggest that curcumin may help regulate circadian rhythms, making it a potential natural remedy for alleviating symptoms of jet lag. Turmeric-based herbal juices can support the body’s adjustment to new time zones by reducing oxidative stress and promoting overall wellness. However, it is important to note that while turmeric may complement other strategies for managing jet lag, it should not replace proper sleep hygiene and gradual time zone adjustment.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating turmeric juice into your routine.</p><h2 id="6">6. Vitex agnus-castus</h2><img alt="vitex agnus-castus juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/vitex-agnus-castus-juices.jpg"/><p>Vitex agnus-castus, commonly known as chasteberry, has been traditionally used to support hormonal balance and may aid in alleviating symptoms of jet lag by regulating the body's internal clock.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, it can help reduce fatigue and mood swings often associated with time zone changes. The adaptogenic properties of vitex may enhance the body's ability to cope with stress and adjust to new environments more quickly. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you are on medication or have existing health conditions.</p><p>While not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene and time zone adjustments, vitex agnus-castus may serve as a complementary natural remedy for managing jet lag symptoms.</p><h2 id="7">7. Melissa officinalis</h2><img alt="melissa officinalis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/melissa-officinalis-juices.jpg"/><p>Melissa officinalis, commonly known as lemon balm, is a calming herb that has been traditionally used to support emotional balance and reduce anxiety.</p><p>When consumed as a herbal juice, it may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality. The soothing properties of lemon balm can assist in regulating the body's circadian rhythm, which is often disrupted during long-haul flights. To prepare the juice, fresh lemon balm leaves are typically blended with water or a mild citrus juice for a refreshing and aromatic drink.</p><p>While it is not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene, incorporating melissa officinalis herbal juice into a wellness routine may offer gentle support for managing the stress and fatigue associated with jet lag.</p><h2 id="8">8. Camellia sinensis</h2><img alt="camellia sinensis juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/camellia-sinensis-juices.jpg"/><p>Camellia sinensis, the plant from which green tea and black tea are derived, contains compounds that may help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by supporting the body's natural circadian rhythms.</p><p>Herbal juices made from Camellia sinensis, such as green tea extracts, are rich in antioxidants and caffeine, which can enhance alertness and reduce fatigue during long flights. These juices may also help regulate sleep patterns by influencing melatonin production, aiding in the adjustment to new time zones. However, it is important to consume them in moderation to avoid overstimulation or digestive discomfort.</p><p>While not a cure for jet lag, Camellia sinensis-based herbal juices can be a complementary remedy to support recovery and well-being during travel.</p><h2 id="9">9. Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/urtica-dioica-juices.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used for its potential health benefits, including its high concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</p><p>While there is limited scientific evidence specifically linking stinging nettle juice to the treatment of jet lag, some proponents suggest that its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying properties may help support the body's adaptation to time zone changes. Herbal juices made from stinging nettle are often consumed for their purported ability to boost energy and enhance overall well-being, which could indirectly aid in managing the symptoms of jet lag. However, it is important to note that more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for this purpose.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating stinging nettle juice into a jet lag management routine.</p><h2 id="10">10. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale juice" src="/images/preparations/juices/zingiber-officinale-juices.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used for its digestive and anti-inflammatory properties, and recent studies suggest it may also aid in managing jet lag.</p><p>Ginger herbal juices can help alleviate the symptoms of jet lag by improving digestion and reducing nausea, which are common after long flights. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, may support the body's circadian rhythm by promoting better sleep and reducing oxidative stress. Drinking ginger juice in the morning can help stimulate the body and ease the transition to a new time zone.</p><p>Incorporating zingiber officinale into a daily routine, especially before and after travel, may offer natural relief from the effects of jet lag.</p>
