<p>Red eyes is a common condition characterized by the redness and inflammation of the eyes, often caused by excessive screen time, allergies, or dryness.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been widely used to treat red eyes due to their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties, which provide relief and promote healing.</p>
<p>Examples of herbs that can help alleviate red eyes include Aloe vera, which cools and calms the eyes, Chamomile, which reduces inflammation and promotes relaxation, and Eyebright, which has anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Herbal preparations such as eye drops or compresses infused with herbs like Lavender, Calendula, and Peppermint can also be effective in treating red eyes, as they help to reduce puffiness, soothe the eyes, and promote healthy circulation.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes red eyes?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of red eyes are irritation and inflammation of the conjunctiva, often resulting from allergens, dust, pollen, or smoke, which trigger an immune response.</p>
<p>Secondary causes can include viral or bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis or pink eye, which lead to inflammation and redness.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing red eyes include prolonged screen time, as it can cause dry eyes due to reduced tear production, and working in dusty or polluted environments, which can cause irritation and inflammation.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who wear contact lenses incorrectly or have a history of allergies may also be more prone to experiencing red eyes.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal red eyes?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat red eyes are typically those with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antihistamine properties.</p>
<p>Herbs like Aloe vera, Echinacea, and Eyebright contain bioactive compounds such as aloin, echinacosides, and flavonoids that help to reduce inflammation and soothe the eyes.</p>
<p>These herbs also exhibit therapeutic actions like inhibiting histamine release, scavenging free radicals, and promoting blood flow to the affected area, which helps to alleviate redness and discomfort.</p>
<p>By utilizing these properties, herbs like Licorice root, which contains glycyrrhizin, can also help to calm and protect the eyes from further irritation.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat red eyes?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat red eyes are made into teas, infusions, or eye washes to alleviate the irritation and inflammation.</p>
<p>A soothing cold compress or a warm poultice prepared with the extract of a certain plant can help to reduce puffiness and ease discomfort.</p>
<p>Infusions made from the dried leaves or flowers of another plant are often used to calm the eyes, while a herbal eye wash prepared from the roots of yet another plant is effective in reducing redness and itchiness.</p>
<p>Additionally, a warm tea made from the bark of a specific tree is sometimes used to help loosen and clear out any debris or allergens that may be contributing to the redness.</p>
