The gel from the aloe plant has a cooling effect that helps to reduce discomfort and promote skin healing. However, it is important to note that while aloe vera may provide relief, it should not replace medical treatment for fungal infections like jock itch.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options.</p><h2 id="2">2.
