As a complementary therapy, sage lozenges may be considered alongside conventional treatments, but it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially for individuals with chronic respiratory issues.</p><p>Overall, while sage lozenges may provide some symptomatic relief, they should not replace medical advice or treatment for severe or persistent shortness of breath.</p>
