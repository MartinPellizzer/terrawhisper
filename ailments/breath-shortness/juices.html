Herbal juices made from vitex agnus-castus are often consumed to promote relaxation and improve overall well-being, which can have a positive impact on breathing patterns. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using vitex agnus-castus, especially for individuals with existing respiratory conditions or those taking medications.</p><p>Overall, while vitex agnus-castus may offer supportive benefits, it should not replace conventional medical treatments for shortness of breath.</p><h2 id="5">5.
