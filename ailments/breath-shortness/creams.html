When applied topically to the chest or back, the warming sensation of the cream may provide a soothing effect, promoting better breathing. However, it is important to note that while these creams can offer temporary relief, they are not a substitute for medical treatment in cases of severe or persistent shortness of breath.</p><p>Always consult a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies for respiratory issues.</p><h2 id="5">5.

These creams may work by enhancing blood flow and reducing inflammation in the airways, which can help alleviate breathing difficulties. However, it is important to note that there is limited clinical evidence supporting their efficacy for shortness of breath, and they should not replace prescribed medical treatments.</p><p>Individuals considering these creams should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure they are safe and appropriate for their specific condition.</p><h2 id="7">7.
