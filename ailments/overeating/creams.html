These creams are often applied topically to the abdomen or chest to reduce inflammation and ease bloating, though they are not a direct remedy for overeating itself. While licorice root may offer some relief for digestive issues, it should not replace a balanced diet and healthy eating habits.</p><p>It is important to consult a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially for prolonged periods or in combination with other medications.</p><h2 id="2">2.

Herbal creams containing Cnicus benedictus are often marketed as natural alternatives to conventional weight management products, though their efficacy and safety require further research. Users should consult with healthcare professionals before incorporating such remedies into their health regimen.</p><p>Despite its traditional use, it is important to approach herbal treatments with caution and prioritize evidence-based approaches for managing overeating.</p><h2 id="7">7.
