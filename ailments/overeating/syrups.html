Black pepper (Piper nigrum)</h2><img alt="piper nigrum syrup" src="/images/preparations/syrups/piper-nigrum-syrups.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is often used in herbal syrups for its potential digestive benefits.</p><p>While black pepper itself is not typically used as a primary treatment for overeating, some herbal formulations may incorporate it to aid in digestion and reduce bloating.
