While they may help with temporary discomfort caused by excessive eating, they do not address the underlying causes of overeating, such as emotional stress or poor dietary habits. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if overeating is a recurring issue, as it may indicate a more serious health concern.</p><p>Overall, herbal lozenges should be used as a complementary aid rather than a solution for managing overeating.</p>

<h2 id="1">1. Glycyrrhiza glabra</h2><img alt="glycyrrhiza glabra lozenge" src="/images/preparations/glycyrrhiza-glabra-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice root, is often used in herbal lozenges to support digestive health and reduce inflammation in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.</p><p>These lozenges may help alleviate symptoms of overeating by soothing the stomach lining and promoting digestion. The active compound, glycyrrhizin, has mild anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties that can ease discomfort associated with overindulgence. While licorice lozenges are generally safe for short-term use, excessive consumption may lead to side effects such as hypertension due to its effect on sodium retention.</p><p>Therefore, they are best used as a complementary remedy under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><h2 id="2">2. Zingiber officinale</h2><img alt="zingiber officinale lozenge" src="/images/preparations/zingiber-officinale-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Zingiber officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been traditionally used to support digestive health and alleviate nausea, making it a popular ingredient in herbal lozenges.</p><p>These lozenges are often formulated to provide a soothing effect on the throat while promoting healthy digestion, which can be beneficial for individuals who experience discomfort after overeating. The active compounds in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, are believed to help reduce inflammation and aid in the breakdown of food, potentially easing post-prandial bloating and discomfort. When used as part of a balanced approach to managing overeating, ginger lozenges may offer a natural and gentle way to support the body's recovery.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using herbal remedies, especially for those with existing medical conditions or who are taking other medications.</p><h2 id="3">3.

Foeniculum vulgare</h2><img alt="foeniculum vulgare lozenge" src="/images/preparations/foeniculum-vulgare-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Foeniculum vulgare, commonly known as fennel, is often used in herbal lozenges to support digestive health and potentially reduce overeating behaviors.</p><p>These lozenges may help alleviate digestive discomfort, such as bloating and indigestion, which can sometimes contribute to overeating. Fennel contains compounds like anethole that have mild carminative and antispasmodic properties, which may promote a sense of fullness and reduce appetite. Some studies suggest that fennel may support healthy digestion and reduce cravings, making it a natural option for those seeking to manage eating habits.</p><p>While not a cure-all, fennel lozenges can be a complementary tool in a holistic approach to addressing overeating.</p><h2 id="5">5. Cuminum cyminum</h2><img alt="cuminum cyminum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/cuminum-cyminum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Cuminum cyminum, commonly known as cumin, is a traditional herb often used in herbal remedies for its digestive and respiratory benefits.</p><p>Cuminum cyminum herbal lozenges are formulated to support digestion and reduce bloating, making them a natural option for individuals who experience discomfort after overeating. These lozenges may help alleviate symptoms such as indigestion, gas, and nausea by promoting healthy gut function. The active compounds in cumin, such as cuminaldehyde and thymol, are believed to have mild carminative and antispasmodic properties.</p><p>While they are not a substitute for a balanced diet, cuminum cyminum lozenges can be a useful complementary aid for managing post-meal discomfort.</p><h2 id="6">6. Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita lozenge" src="/images/preparations/mentha-piperita-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is a popular herbal ingredient used in lozenges to aid in managing overeating by promoting a sense of fullness and reducing appetite.</p><p>These lozenges are often formulated with natural mint oil, which can help soothe the digestive system and enhance the feeling of satiety. The refreshing taste of peppermint can also help curb cravings and encourage mindful eating habits. Additionally, peppermint has mild stimulant properties that may help improve digestion and reduce bloating associated with overeating.</p><p>As a natural alternative to artificial appetite suppressants, peppermint lozenges offer a safe and pleasant way to support healthier eating habits.</p><h2 id="7">7. Piper nigrum</h2><img alt="piper nigrum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/piper-nigrum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Piper nigrum, commonly known as black pepper, is often used in herbal lozenges to support digestion and reduce cravings associated with overeating.</p><p>These lozenges contain piperine, a compound that enhances the absorption of nutrients and may help regulate appetite by influencing metabolic processes. The warming properties of black pepper can also soothe the digestive system, making it beneficial for those who experience bloating or discomfort after overeating. While not a substitute for a balanced diet, Piper nigrum lozenges may serve as a natural complement to help manage overeating habits.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using these lozenges, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or those taking medications.</p><h2 id="8">8. Piper methysticum</h2><img alt="piper methysticum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/piper-methysticum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Piper methysticum, commonly known as kava, is traditionally used in Polynesian cultures for its calming and relaxing effects.</p><p>While kava is not typically used as a treatment for overeating, some individuals may use kava-based herbal lozenges to manage stress and anxiety, which can indirectly influence eating behaviors. These lozenges are often marketed as natural remedies to promote relaxation and reduce emotional eating triggers. However, it is important to note that there is limited scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness for weight management or appetite suppression.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating kava lozenges into a health regimen.</p><h2 id="9">9. Silybum marianum</h2><img alt="silybum marianum lozenge" src="/images/preparations/silybum-marianum-lozenges.jpg"/><p>Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle, is a herbal remedy that has been traditionally used for its potential liver-protective properties.</p><p>While primarily studied for its effects on liver health, some research suggests that silybum marianum may also support digestive wellness, which could indirectly aid in managing overeating behaviors. Herbal lozenges containing silybum marianum are often marketed as natural supplements to promote a sense of fullness and reduce cravings, though scientific evidence for their effectiveness in treating overeating is limited. These lozenges may be used as part of a holistic approach to weight management, alongside diet and lifestyle changes.</p><p>However, individuals considering silybum marianum lozenges should consult with a healthcare provider to ensure safety and appropriateness for their specific health needs.</p><h2 id="10">10.
