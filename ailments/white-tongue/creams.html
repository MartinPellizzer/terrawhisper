The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of aloe vera help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that may contribute to the condition. When applied topically, aloe-based creams can promote the shedding of dead cells and encourage the growth of healthy tissue.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional to rule out underlying causes such as oral infections or gastrointestinal issues.</p><h2 id="2">2. Salvia officinalis</h2><img alt="salvia officinalis cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/salvia-officinalis-creams.jpg"/><p>Salvia officinalis, commonly known as sage, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for various oral health issues, including the treatment of white tongue.</p><p>Herbal creams containing salvia officinalis are formulated with natural extracts that may help reduce inflammation and soothe oral discomfort. These creams are often applied directly to the affected area to promote healing and alleviate symptoms associated with a white tongue. The antimicrobial and astringent properties of sage may help combat infections and reduce the buildup of oral bacteria.</p><p>However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using these creams, especially if the condition persists or is accompanied by other symptoms.</p><h2 id="3">3. Echinacea purpurea</h2><img alt="echinacea purpurea cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/echinacea-purpurea-creams.jpg"/><p>Echinacea purpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a popular herbal remedy often used in the formulation of natural creams for oral health issues, including white tongue.</p><p>These creams typically combine echinacea with other soothing ingredients like aloe vera or honey to create a calming effect on the mouth's delicate tissues. While some studies suggest that echinacea may have antimicrobial properties that could help reduce oral infections, its effectiveness for specifically treating white tongue remains inconclusive. Many users report relief from discomfort and a reduction in the appearance of white patches when using echinacea-based creams regularly.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such products, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.</p><h2 id="4">4.

Hypericum perforatum</h2><img alt="hypericum perforatum cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/hypericum-perforatum-creams.jpg"/><p>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is often used in herbal remedies for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>While it is more commonly associated with treating mild depression, some herbal creams containing Hypericum perforatum may be used topically to address oral issues like white tongue, which can result from inflammation, infection, or poor oral hygiene. These creams may help reduce the appearance of white patches by soothing the oral mucosa and promoting healing. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before using such products, as they may interact with other medications or have side effects.</p><p>Overall, while Hypericum perforatum herbal creams may offer some relief for white tongue, they are not a substitute for proper dental care and medical advice.</p><h2 id="6">6. Cinnamomum verum</h2><img alt="cinnamomum verum cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/cinnamomum-verum-creams.jpg"/><p>Cinnamomum verum, also known as true cinnamon, has been traditionally used in herbal remedies for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, it can help soothe and treat white tongue by reducing bacterial buildup on the tongue's surface. These creams often combine cinnamon with other natural ingredients like honey, coconut oil, or peppermint to enhance their effectiveness and comfort.

Urtica dioica</h2><img alt="urtica dioica cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/urtica-dioica-creams.jpg"/><p>Urtica dioica, commonly known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p>When incorporated into herbal creams, it may offer relief for conditions like white tongue, which is often caused by inflammation or infection in the mouth.

Mentha piperita</h2><img alt="mentha piperita cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/mentha-piperita-creams.jpg"/><p>Mentha piperita, commonly known as peppermint, is often incorporated into herbal creams due to its cooling and soothing properties.</p><p>These creams are traditionally used to alleviate discomfort associated with conditions like white tongue, a condition characterized by a white coating on the tongue's surface.
