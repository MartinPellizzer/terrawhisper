Aloe barbadensis</h2><img alt="aloe barbadensis capsule" src="/images/preparations/capsules/aloe-barbadensis-capsules.jpg"/><p>Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is often used in herbal capsules for its potential therapeutic properties.</p><p>These capsules may be marketed for their ability to support oral health, including the treatment of white tongue, a condition characterized by a thick, white coating on the tongue.
