Herbal syrups made from Hypericum perforatum are often prepared with honey or other natural sweeteners to enhance palatability and bioavailability. However, it is important to note that scientific evidence specifically linking St. John's Wort to the treatment of eye twitching is limited, and its use should be discussed with a healthcare provider, especially since it can interact with other medications.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, individual responses may vary, and it should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment.</p><h2 id="2">2.
