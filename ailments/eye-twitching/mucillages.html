While scientific research on valerian mucillages specifically for eye twitching is limited, some traditional herbal practices suggest that these compounds may support overall eye health by promoting relaxation and reducing stress-related symptoms. Although valerian is more commonly used in the form of teas or supplements, its mucillages could be incorporated into topical applications or eye compresses under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a qualified practitioner before using valerian mucillages for eye twitching, especially if other underlying conditions are present.</p><h2 id="6">6.
