These topical applications are believed to provide a calming effect by promoting relaxation and reducing feelings of stress. While valerian root is often consumed as a tea or supplement, its use in creams allows for localized application, potentially offering targeted relief for muscle tension and anxiety-related discomfort.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is important to consult a healthcare professional before use, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2.

While some users report a soothing effect from the topical application, it is important to note that the primary benefits of passionflower are generally associated with oral consumption rather than topical use.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating passiflora incarnata creams into a self-care routine for anxiety.</p><h2 id="3">3.

These creams are typically made by infusing the dried plant material into a carrier oil, allowing for easy application and absorption through the skin.</p><p>However, it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using St. John's Wort, as it can interact with certain medications and may have side effects.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Turmeric (Curcuma longa)</h2><img alt="curcuma longa cream" src="/images/preparations/creams/curcuma-longa-creams.jpg"/><p>Curcuma longa, commonly known as turmeric, has been widely studied for its potential therapeutic effects on anxiety due to its active compound, curcumin.</p><p>Herbal creams containing curcumin are gaining popularity as natural remedies for managing anxiety symptoms, offering a gentler alternative to conventional pharmaceutical treatments.
