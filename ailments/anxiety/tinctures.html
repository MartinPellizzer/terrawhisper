<h2 id="1">1. Valeriana officinalis</h2><img alt="valeriana officinalis tincture" src="/images/preparations/valeriana-officinalis-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Valeriana officinalis, commonly known as valerian, is a traditional herbal remedy that has been used for centuries to address anxiety and sleep disorders.</p><p>Its tinctures are concentrated extracts made by soaking the dried root of the plant in alcohol, which helps preserve its active compounds. These tinctures are often taken orally and are believed to work by increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, promoting relaxation and reducing nervousness. While valerian tinctures are generally considered safe for short-term use, they may cause drowsiness or digestive upset in some individuals.</p><p>As with any herbal remedy, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting valerian tinctures, especially if you are on other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="2">2. Passiflora incarnata</h2><img alt="passiflora incarnata tincture" src="/images/preparations/passiflora-incarnata-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Passiflora incarnata, commonly known as passionflower, is a popular herb used in tinctures to help alleviate symptoms of anxiety.</p><p>The tinctures are typically made by soaking the dried leaves and flowers in alcohol, creating a potent extract that can be taken orally.

These tinctures are believed to help alleviate symptoms of anxiety by modulating stress hormones and supporting adrenal function. However, long-term use of licorice root tinctures can lead to side effects such as hypertension due to the effects of glycyrrhizin on sodium and potassium levels.</p><p>As a result, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using glycyrrhiza glabra tinctures, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking other medications.</p><h2 id="4">4.

However, it is important to note that St. John's wort can interact with various medications, including antidepressants and birth control, so it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p><p>Despite its historical use and anecdotal support, more clinical research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in treating anxiety.</p><h2 id="5">5.

Studies suggest that ashwagandha may reduce cortisol levels and enhance resilience to stress, making it a natural alternative for those seeking relief from anxiety.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any herbal treatment, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p><h2 id="6">6.

When used as part of a holistic approach, lemon balm tinctures can support emotional balance and improve sleep quality in individuals experiencing stress or anxiety.</p><p>However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any herbal treatment, especially for those taking other medications or with pre-existing health conditions.</p><h2 id="8">8. Avena sativa</h2><img alt="avena sativa tincture" src="/images/preparations/avena-sativa-tinctures.jpg"/><p>Avena sativa, commonly known as oat straw, is a herbal tincture that has been traditionally used to support mental well-being and alleviate symptoms of anxiety.</p><p>This calming herb is believed to work by promoting a sense of relaxation and reducing mental agitation through its mild sedative properties.

These tinctures are typically taken in small, consistent doses and are believed to influence neurotransmitter activity and hormonal fluctuations that contribute to anxiety. While scientific research on Vitex agnus-castus is ongoing, many users report a calming effect and improved mood when using these tinctures.</p><p>As with any herbal supplement, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting Vitex agnus-castus, especially if you are taking other medications or have underlying health conditions.</p>
