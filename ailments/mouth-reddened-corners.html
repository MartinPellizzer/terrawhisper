<p>Reddened corners in mouth, also known as angular cheilitis, is a common condition characterized by redness, swelling, and sometimes painful inflammation of the corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>Herbal remedies have been used to effectively treat this ailment due to their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal properties, which help to soothe and heal the affected area.</p>
<p>Certain herbs such as aloe vera, calendula, and chamomile are particularly beneficial in treating angular cheilitis, as they have anti-inflammatory and soothing properties that help to reduce redness and swelling.</p>
<p>Additionally, herbal preparations such as aloe vera gel, calendula cream, and tea tree oil-infused lip balms can be applied topically to provide relief from the symptoms of angular cheilitis, while herbal teas like peppermint and ginger can be consumed to help reduce inflammation and promote healing.</p>

<h2 id="0">What causes reddened corners in mouth?</h2>
<p>The primary causes of reddened corners in mouth are angular cheilitis, a condition caused by fungal or bacterial infections, and vitamin deficiencies such as B2 (riboflavin), B6, or B12.</p>
<p>Secondary causes include dry mouth due to medications, hormonal changes, and poor oral hygiene, which can lead to irritation and inflammation in the corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>Lifestyles that increase the chances of developing this ailment include smoking, which reduces saliva production and increases the risk of fungal infections, and a diet lacking essential nutrients, particularly in older adults or individuals with certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, people who wear dentures or orthodontic appliances may be more prone to angular cheilitis due to the constant irritation and rubbing of these devices against the skin.</p>

<h2 id="1">What herbs heal reddened corners in mouth?</h2>
<p>The medicinal herbs used to treat reddened corners in mouth are Aloe vera, Calendula, and Echinacea, which have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help reduce redness and soothe the affected area.</p>
<p>Aloe vera's therapeutic actions include reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing, which is attributed to its bioactive compounds such as aloin and aloe-emodin, while Calendula's actions include stimulating tissue repair and reducing bacterial growth, due to its bioactive compounds like triterpenoids and flavonoids.</p>
<p>Echinacea, on the other hand, has immunomodulatory effects that help boost the body's natural defense against infections, thanks to its bioactive compounds like alkylamides and polyphenols.</p>
<p>These herbs can be used topically or taken internally in the form of teas, tinctures, or extracts to alleviate the symptoms of reddened corners in mouth.</p>

<h2 id="2">What preparations treat reddened corners in mouth?</h2>
<p>The herbal preparations used to treat reddened corners in mouth are a variety of teas, infusions, and mouthwashes that have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Some examples of these preparations include a soothing tea that can be gargled to calm irritated tissues, a mouthwash infused with a fragrant oil that helps to reduce swelling, a cooling gel that can be applied topically to numb the affected area, and a warm infusion that can be swished around the mouth to loosen and clear out debris.</p>
<p>These preparations work by reducing inflammation, killing bacteria and other pathogens, and promoting the healing of damaged tissues.</p>
<p>By using these herbal preparations regularly, individuals can help to alleviate the symptoms of reddened corners in mouth and promote overall oral health.</p>
