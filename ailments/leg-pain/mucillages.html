When applied topically in the form of salves or poultices, the mucillages provide a soothing effect and enhance the absorption of other healing agents. However, due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, internal use is generally discouraged to avoid potential liver toxicity.</p><p>Despite these risks, external application of Symphytum officinale mucillages remains a popular natural remedy for supporting recovery from leg injuries and chronic pain.</p><h2 id="7">7.
